## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Strategic Challenge

Carey Olsen's Corporate Services team faces a critical technology decision. Quantios has confirmed its strategic investment in Quantios Core and phase-out of ViewPoint, the current entity management platform used for decades. This creates both urgency and opportunity to evaluate modern cloud-native CSP platforms.

### Current Technology Stack

- **Entity Management**: ViewPoint (being phased out)
- **Financial System**: Elite 3E (Thomson Reuters)
- **Matter Management**: Intapp
- **CRM Platform**: Peppermint CRM (Dynamics 365)

### Key Market Findings

- 10+ major vendors identified in CSP/entity management space
- Market split between TCSP-specialised (Quantios, Vistra) and enterprise platforms (CSC, Diligent, Athennian)
- Strong trend toward cloud-native, AI-enhanced solutions
- Microsoft ecosystem integration now table-stakes

### Top 3 Recommended Vendors (Weighted Score out of 5.0)

**Tier 1 Recommendations (Score 4.5):**

- **Vistra Platform** - Global CSP leader with AI assistant and single source of truth

**Tier 3 Recommendation (Score 4.3):**

- **Quantios Core** - Natural ViewPoint upgrade path, TCSP-specialised

### Strategic Recommendation

**PRIMARY: Best-of-Breed Competitive Tender**

Issue comprehensive RFP to: CSC Entity Management, Athennian, Vistra Platform, Quantios Core

**Timeline**: 15 months (5 months vendor selection + 10 months implementation)
**Budget**: £477k–£620k Year 1; £725k–£1M over 3 years
**Go-Live**: October 2027
**ROI**: Positive £200k–£1M over 3 years

## MARKET LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

### Market Segmentation

The CSP software market is segmented into four primary tiers:

**Tier 1: TCSP-Specialised Global Platforms**
- Quantios Core, Vistra Platform
- Strength: TCSP-specific compliance and features
- Weakness: Potential for higher cost; less enterprise-grade stability

**Tier 2: Enterprise Entity Management Leaders**
- CSC Entity Management, Athennian, Diligent Entities
- Strength: Enterprise-grade stability; comprehensive feature sets
- Weakness: May be over-engineered for CSP needs

**Tier 3: Mid-Market & Service Provider Focused**
- TMF Group, Filejet
- Strength: Cost-effective; tailored to specific segments
- Weakness: Scalability concerns; limited roadmap

**Tier 4: Legacy Platforms (Not Recommended)**
- Quantios vPoint
- Strength: Continuity from ViewPoint
- Weakness: Limited innovation; legacy technology constraints

### Key Market Trends

1. **Cloud-Native Adoption**: All major vendors now cloud-based; no perpetual licences
2. **AI & Automation**: AI assistants, workflow automation, compliance automation becoming standard
3. **Integration-First Architecture**: APIs and ecosystem integration critical
4. **Compliance Automation**: AEOI/CRS, economic substance tracking automated

## Appendix B: Methodology

### Vendor Assessment Methodology

The vendor assessment uses a **weighted scoring model** across seven dimensions:

1. **Functional Capabilities** (weight: 0.36) – Core CSP features and functionality
2. **Technical Architecture** (weight: 0.27) – Cloud-native, scalability, security
3. **Integration Capabilities** (weight: 0.30) – 3E, Intapp, Peppermint connectivity
4. **Compliance Features** (weight: 0.28) – Multi-jurisdiction, AEOI/CRS, AML/KYC
5. **User Experience** (weight: 0.07) – Ease of use, training requirements
6. **Vendor Stability** (weight: 0.16) – Financial health, roadmap, support
7. **Financial Considerations** (weight: 0.13) – TCO, pricing model, ROI

Each vendor is scored 1–5 in each dimension, then multiplied by the dimension weighting to produce a weighted total score out of 5.0.

**Scoring Scale:**
- 5 = Excellent – best in class
- 4 = Good – meets all requirements well
- 3 = Adequate – meets most requirements
- 2 = Below expectations – gaps in key areas
- 1 = Poor – significant deficiencies

### Risk Assessment Methodology

Risks are assessed using a **probability × impact** matrix:

**Probability (1–3):**
- 3 = High (>50% likelihood)
- 2 = Medium (20–50% likelihood)
- 1 = Low (<20% likelihood)

**Impact (1–4):**
- 4 = Critical (project failure or >£200k impact)
- 3 = High (major delays or £100k–£200k impact)
- 2 = Medium (moderate delays or £50k–£100k impact)
- 1 = Low (<£50k impact or minor delays)

**Risk Score = Probability × Impact** (scale: 1–12)
- Score 9–12: Critical priority – immediate action required
- Score 6–8: High priority – mitigation plan needed
- Score 3–5: Medium priority – monitor and manage
- Score 1–2: Low priority – accept or transfer
