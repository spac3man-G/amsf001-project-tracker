# Chapter 1.1: Welcome to Tracker

## Overview

This chapter introduces you to Tracker by Progressive, explains what the application does, and helps you understand the key concepts you'll use every day.

## Why This Matters

Before you start using any new tool, you need to understand what it's for and how it fits into your work. Tracker is designed to make project management easier for everyone involved - whether you're running the project or working on it. Understanding the basics will help you get the most from the system.

## What is Tracker?

Tracker by Progressive is a project management application built for professional services organisations. It helps teams:

- **Plan projects** - Break down work into milestones, deliverables, and tasks
- **Track progress** - See how work is progressing against the plan
- **Manage finances** - Log time, claim expenses, and track billing
- **Handle changes** - Manage variations and keep stakeholders informed
- **Stay organised** - Keep risks, issues, and dependencies visible

Think of Tracker as your project command centre. Everything about your project lives here - the plan, the people, the progress, and the paperwork.

## Who Uses Tracker?

Tracker is designed for two types of organisations working together:

### Suppliers (Delivery Teams)
These are the organisations doing the work. They might be:
- IT consultancies delivering software projects
- Professional services firms implementing systems
- Agencies running campaigns or programmes

Suppliers use Tracker to plan their work, log their time, and track what they've delivered.

### Customers (Client Teams)
These are the organisations receiving the work. They use Tracker to:
- Review and approve deliverables
- Track project progress
- Sign off milestones
- Monitor costs against budget

The power of Tracker is that both sides see the same information. This transparency builds trust and keeps everyone aligned.

## Key Concepts

Before we go further, let's define some terms you'll see throughout Tracker:

### Organisation
An organisation is a company or team using Tracker. When you sign up, you create or join an organisation. Each organisation can have multiple projects.

### Project
A project is a piece of work with a start date, end date, and defined deliverables. Projects contain all the planning, tracking, and financial information for that piece of work.

### Milestones
Milestones are the major checkpoints in your project. They might be:
- Phases of work (like "Discovery" or "Development")
- Payment points (where the customer pays for completed work)
- Sign-off gates (where formal approval is needed)

### Deliverables
Deliverables are the things you actually produce. Each deliverable belongs to a milestone. Examples include documents, designs, code releases, or training sessions.

### Tasks
Tasks are the individual pieces of work needed to complete a deliverable. They're assigned to team members and tracked to completion.

## Accessing Tracker

### Logging In

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge all work well)
2. Go to your Tracker URL (typically `tracker.yourcompany.com` or `app.tracker.com`)
3. Enter your email address
4. Enter your password
5. Click **Sign In**

[Screenshot placeholder: Login screen with email and password fields]

### First-Time Users

If this is your first time using Tracker, you'll have received an invitation email. This email contains:
- A link to set up your account
- Instructions for creating your password
- The name of the organisation you're joining

Click the link in the email and follow the prompts to create your password.

### Forgot Your Password?

If you've forgotten your password:

1. Go to the login page
2. Click **Forgot Password?**
3. Enter your email address
4. Click **Send Reset Link**
5. Check your email for the reset link
6. Click the link and create a new password

The reset link expires after 24 hours for security reasons.

## After You Log In

Once you're logged in, you'll see the Dashboard. This is your home base in Tracker. From here you can:

- See an overview of your current project
- Access different features using the sidebar menu
- Switch between projects (if you're on more than one)
- Use the AI Chat Assistant for help

Don't worry if this feels like a lot - we'll cover everything step by step in the following chapters.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Bookmark the login page** - You'll use it often, so make it easy to find
- **Use a strong password** - Your project data is valuable, so protect it
- **Check your email** - Tracker sends notifications about important updates
- **Ask for help** - The AI Chat Assistant (bottom-right corner) can answer questions

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use Tracker on my phone?**
A: Yes! Tracker works on mobile browsers. While some features are easier on a larger screen, you can log time, check status, and review information on your phone.

**Q: How many projects can I be on?**
A: There's no limit. You can be a member of as many projects as needed. Use the project switcher in the top navigation to move between them.

**Q: What if I'm in multiple organisations?**
A: You can be a member of multiple organisations. When you log in, you'll see a list of organisations you belong to. Select the one you want to work in.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes. Tracker uses enterprise-grade security including encryption, secure authentication, and role-based access controls. Your data is stored securely and backed up regularly.

# Chapter 1.2: Understanding Your Role

## Overview

This chapter explains the different roles in Tracker, what each role can do, and how to know which role you have.

## Why This Matters

Your role determines what you can see and do in Tracker. Understanding roles helps you know:
- What features you have access to
- What actions you can take
- Who to ask when you need something done that's outside your permissions

Roles keep the system secure by ensuring people only access what they need for their job.

## The Six Project Roles

Every person on a project has exactly one role. Here's what each role means:

### 1. Supplier PM (Project Manager)

**Who has this role:** The person managing the project from the supplier (delivery) side.

**What they can do:**
- Everything! Full access to all features
- Create and edit the project plan
- Approve timesheets and expenses
- Sign off on deliverables (supplier side)
- Create variations (change requests)
- Manage team members
- Access all reports and settings

**When you might be this:** You're the lead project manager responsible for delivery.

### 2. Customer PM (Project Manager)

**Who has this role:** The person managing the project from the customer (client) side.

**What they can do:**
- View all project information
- Sign off on deliverables (customer side)
- Approve variations
- Access reports
- Cannot edit the project plan directly
- Cannot approve supplier timesheets

**When you might be this:** You're the client's project manager overseeing the work.

### 3. Supplier Finance

**Who has this role:** Finance team members from the supplier organisation.

**What they can do:**
- Approve timesheets and expenses
- Manage billing and invoicing
- View financial reports
- Limited access to project planning features

**When you might be this:** You handle billing or financial operations for project work.

### 4. Customer Finance

**Who has this role:** Finance team members from the customer organisation.

**What they can do:**
- Review invoices and billing
- View financial reports
- Cannot approve supplier timesheets
- Limited access to operational features

**When you might be this:** You review and process invoices from suppliers.

### 5. Contributor

**Who has this role:** Team members actively working on the project.

**What they can do:**
- Log timesheets
- Submit expenses
- Update task progress
- View project information
- Add comments and notes
- Cannot approve anything
- Cannot edit the project plan

**When you might be this:** You're a developer, analyst, designer, or other team member doing the work.

### 6. Viewer

**Who has this role:** Stakeholders who need to see information but not change anything.

**What they can do:**
- View all project information
- Run reports
- Cannot edit, approve, or submit anything

**When you might be this:** You're an executive sponsor, auditor, or observer.

## How to Know Your Role

### Check the User Menu

1. Look at the top-right corner of the screen
2. Click your name or profile icon
3. Your current role is shown below your name

[Screenshot placeholder: User menu showing role]

### Check the "View As" Feature

If you're a Supplier PM, you'll see a "View As" dropdown. This lets you see the application as another role would see it - useful for understanding what your team members experience.

1. Click the "View As" dropdown in the header
2. Select a role to preview
3. The screen will update to show that role's view
4. Select your own role to return to normal

## Supplier vs Customer Perspective

One important concept in Tracker is the **supplier/customer relationship**:

### Suppliers
- Deliver the work
- Create the project plan
- Log time and expenses
- Submit deliverables for sign-off
- Request changes via variations

### Customers
- Receive the work
- Review and approve deliverables
- Sign off on milestones
- Approve variations
- Monitor progress and spending

Both sides need to work together. A deliverable isn't complete until both the supplier (who did the work) and the customer (who received it) sign off.

## What You Can See vs What You Can Do

Here's a quick reference table:

| Feature | Supplier PM | Customer PM | Supplier Finance | Customer Finance | Contributor | Viewer |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|--------|
| View Dashboard | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Edit Project Plan | Yes | No | No | No | No | No |
| Log Timesheets | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | No |
| Approve Timesheets | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | No |
| Submit Expenses | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Sign Off Deliverables | Supplier | Customer | No | No | No | No |
| Create Variations | Yes | No | No | No | No | No |
| Approve Variations | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Manage Team | Yes | No | No | No | No | No |

## Requesting Role Changes

If you need a different role:

1. Contact your Supplier PM - they manage project team members
2. Explain what you need to do that your current role doesn't allow
3. The PM can update your role if appropriate

Role changes take effect immediately.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Start with the minimum role needed** - It's easy to upgrade; harder to explain why someone had unnecessary access
- **Use View As to train team members** - Show them what they'll see before they log in
- **Document who has each role** - Keep a record for audit and handover purposes

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I have different roles on different projects?**
A: Yes. Your role is per-project. You might be a Contributor on one project and a Supplier PM on another.

**Q: Can I have multiple roles on the same project?**
A: No. Each person has exactly one role per project. If you need to do things that span roles, talk to the project manager.

**Q: What happens if my role changes?**
A: Your access updates immediately. Items you created (like timesheets) stay associated with you.

**Q: Why can't I see certain menu items?**
A: Your role may not have access to those features. Check your role and contact your PM if you need access.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-01-02-001:** Identify your current role from the user menu
- [ ] **UAT-01-02-002:** (Supplier PM only) Use "View As" to preview the Contributor role
- [ ] **UAT-01-02-003:** Verify the sidebar menu shows only features available to your role
- [ ] **UAT-01-02-004:** Attempt to access a feature outside your role permissions and see appropriate restriction message

# Chapter 1.3: Navigating the Application

## Overview

This chapter shows you how to move around Tracker, find what you need, and use the main navigation features.

## Why This Matters

A tool is only useful if you can find what you need. Tracker organises information logically, but knowing where to look will save you time and frustration. Once you understand the layout, you'll move through the application with confidence.

## The Main Screen Layout

When you log in, you'll see four main areas:

### 1. The Header Bar (Top)
This bar stays at the top of every page. It contains:
- **Logo** - Click to return to the Dashboard
- **Organisation/Project selector** - Switch between organisations and projects
- **Search** - Find items quickly across the current project
- **User menu** - Access your profile, settings, and logout

### 2. The Sidebar (Left)
This is your main navigation menu. It shows all the features available to you based on your role. We'll cover each item in detail below.

### 3. The Main Content Area (Centre)
This is where the action happens. The content changes based on what you select from the sidebar.

### 4. The AI Chat Assistant (Bottom-Right)
A small chat icon in the bottom-right corner. Click it to ask questions or get help.

[Screenshot placeholder: Annotated main screen showing all four areas]

## The Sidebar Menu

The sidebar is organised into logical groups. Here's what you'll find:

### Project Section
- **Dashboard** - Your project overview with key metrics
- **Calendar** - See milestones and deliverables on a timeline
- **Task View** - Your assigned tasks in one place

### Planning Section
- **Planner** - Build and manage your work breakdown structure
- **Variations** - Manage change requests

### Tracking Section
- **Milestones** - View and manage project milestones
- **Deliverables** - Track what you're delivering
- **KPIs** - Key performance indicators

### Records Section
- **RAID Log** - Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies
- **Timesheets** - Log and view time entries
- **Expenses** - Submit and track expense claims

### Finance Section (Supplier PM and Finance roles)
- **Resources** - Manage project team and rates
- **Partners** - Subcontractor and partner management
- **Reports** - Financial and project reports

### Admin Section (Supplier PM only)
- **Project Settings** - Configure project options
- **Organisation Admin** - Manage organisation-wide settings

## Switching Projects

If you're on multiple projects:

1. Click the project name in the header
2. A dropdown appears showing all your projects
3. Click the project you want to switch to
4. The entire view updates to show that project

[Screenshot placeholder: Project switcher dropdown]

**Tip:** Recent projects appear at the top of the list for quick access.

## Switching Organisations

If you're a member of multiple organisations:

1. Click your profile in the top-right corner
2. Click **Switch Organisation**
3. Select the organisation from the list
4. You'll be taken to that organisation's default project

## Using Search

The search bar helps you find items quickly:

1. Click the search icon in the header (or press **Ctrl+K** / **Cmd+K**)
2. Type what you're looking for
3. Results appear as you type
4. Click a result to go directly to that item

**What you can search for:**
- Milestones (by name)
- Deliverables (by name)
- Tasks (by name)
- RAID items (by reference number like R-001)
- Team members (by name)

[Screenshot placeholder: Search results dropdown]

## The AI Chat Assistant

The chat assistant is your on-demand help. To use it:

1. Click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner
2. Type your question in plain English
3. The AI responds with helpful information

**Things you can ask:**
- "How do I submit a timesheet?"
- "Show me overdue deliverables"
- "What milestones are due this month?"
- "Submit my timesheets" (it can even do things for you!)

The chat assistant knows about your project data and can answer specific questions like "What's the status of the Design milestone?"

[Screenshot placeholder: Chat assistant open with example conversation]

## Breadcrumbs

When you're deep in the application, breadcrumbs show where you are:

`Home > Milestones > Phase 1 > Requirements Complete`

Click any part of the breadcrumb to jump back to that level.

## Common Navigation Patterns

### Viewing a List, Then Details
Most features follow this pattern:
1. Click a menu item to see a list (e.g., Milestones)
2. Click an item in the list to see its details
3. Use the back button or breadcrumbs to return to the list

### Using Filters
Lists often have filters at the top:
- **Status** - Show only items in a certain state
- **Date Range** - Show items within dates
- **Assigned To** - Show items for a specific person

Click **Clear Filters** to reset and see everything.

### Taking Actions
Actions are typically found in two places:
- **Buttons at the top of a page** - For creating new items
- **Action menus (three dots)** - For actions on existing items

[Screenshot placeholder: Action menu example]

## Keyboard Shortcuts

For power users:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl+K** / **Cmd+K** | Open search |
| **Esc** | Close modals and panels |
| **?** | Show keyboard shortcuts (from Dashboard) |

## Mobile Navigation

On smaller screens:
- The sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu (three lines)
- Tap the menu icon to show/hide the sidebar
- All features work the same, just arranged for smaller screens

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Start on the Dashboard** - It gives you the big picture before you dive into details
- **Use search for specific items** - Faster than navigating through menus
- **Learn the sidebar structure** - You'll use it constantly
- **Try the AI assistant** - It can often answer questions faster than searching documentation

## Common Questions

**Q: Why can't I see certain menu items?**
A: Your role determines what you can see. Some items only appear for Supplier PM, Finance roles, or specific permissions.

**Q: Can I customise the sidebar?**
A: The sidebar shows items based on your role and project settings. Some features can be enabled or disabled at the project level.

**Q: How do I get back to the Dashboard?**
A: Click the logo in the top-left corner, or click "Dashboard" in the sidebar.

**Q: Why does search not find what I'm looking for?**
A: Search looks in the current project only. If you can't find something, check you're in the right project, or try different search terms.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-01-03-001:** Navigate to every main sidebar menu item and verify the page loads
- [ ] **UAT-01-03-002:** Use the search feature to find a milestone by name
- [ ] **UAT-01-03-003:** Switch between two different projects using the project selector
- [ ] **UAT-01-03-004:** Open the AI Chat Assistant and ask a question about the project
- [ ] **UAT-01-03-005:** Use breadcrumbs to navigate back from a detail page to a list page

Your organisation is the foundation of everything in Tracker. It's where your projects live, your team members belong, and your settings apply. Getting your organisation set up correctly from the start saves time and confusion later.

## What is an Organisation?

In Tracker, an organisation represents your company or team. Think of it as a container that holds:

- **All your projects** - Every project you create belongs to your organisation
- **All your team members** - People you invite join your organisation first, then get assigned to projects
- **Your settings** - Branding, defaults, and preferences that apply across all projects

Most users belong to one organisation - their employer. However, some users (like consultants) might belong to multiple organisations.

## When Do You Need to Create an Organisation?

You need to create an organisation when:

- **You're starting fresh** - Your company is new to Tracker
- **You're a supplier** - You deliver work to customers and need to manage your projects
- **You want separate workspaces** - Different divisions of your company need isolated environments

You don't need to create an organisation when:

- **You've been invited** - Someone else already created the organisation and invited you
- **You're joining a customer's project** - The supplier creates the project; you just join it

## Step-by-Step: Creating Your Organisation

### Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A valid email address (this will be your admin account)
- Your company name
- Optionally, your company logo (PNG or JPG, at least 200x200 pixels)

### Creating the Organisation

1. **Go to the Tracker sign-up page**
   - If you don't have an account, click **Sign Up**
   - If you have an account but no organisation, you'll be prompted to create one

2. **Enter your organisation name**
   - Use your company's official name
   - This appears throughout Tracker and on reports
   - Example: "Acme Consulting Ltd" or "Progressive Digital Services"

3. **Choose your organisation type**
   - **Supplier** - You deliver work to customers
   - **Customer** - You receive work from suppliers (less common as primary organisation)

4. **Add your logo (optional but recommended)**
   - Click the logo upload area
   - Select your logo file
   - The logo appears in the header and on reports

5. **Set your time zone**
   - Choose the time zone where most of your team works
   - This affects how dates and times display

6. **Review and create**
   - Check your details
   - Click **Create Organisation**

[Screenshot placeholder: Organisation creation form]

### After Creation

Once your organisation is created:

1. **You become the owner** - You have full administrative rights
2. **You'll see the Dashboard** - But it will be empty until you create a project
3. **You can invite team members** - Add your colleagues (covered in Chapter 2.2)
4. **You can create your first project** - Covered in Part 3

## Organisation Types Explained

### Supplier Organisations

Supplier organisations are for companies that deliver work. They can:
- Create and manage projects
- Invite team members with any role
- Create customer accounts for their clients
- Access all financial and planning features

### Customer Organisations

Customer organisations are typically created by suppliers for their clients. They have:
- Access to projects they've been invited to
- Ability to review and approve deliverables
- Read access to project information
- Limited administrative capabilities

**Note:** Most organisations are suppliers. Customer organisations are usually created when onboarding a client who needs their own workspace.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use your official company name** - It appears on reports and invoices
- **Upload a high-quality logo** - It makes reports look professional
- **Set the correct time zone** - Especially important for distributed teams
- **Keep it simple** - One organisation per company is usually enough

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I rename my organisation later?**
A: Yes. Go to Organisation Admin → Settings → General to change the name.

**Q: Can I have multiple organisations?**
A: Yes, but it's rarely needed. Most companies use one organisation with multiple projects.

**Q: What if I was invited but need my own organisation?**
A: You can create a new organisation from the user menu. You'll then belong to both.

**Q: Can I delete an organisation?**
A: Contact support for organisation deletion. This is irreversible and removes all data.

**Q: Who owns the organisation?**
A: The person who creates it is the initial owner. Ownership can be transferred to another admin.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-02-01-001:** Create a new organisation with a name and logo
- [ ] **UAT-02-01-002:** Verify the organisation name appears in the header after creation
- [ ] **UAT-02-01-003:** Verify the logo appears in the header after upload

# Chapter 2.2: Managing Organisation Members

## Overview

This chapter covers how to invite people to your organisation, manage their access, assign them to projects, and handle common team management tasks.

## Why This Matters

Your team is what makes projects happen. Getting the right people into Tracker with the right access is essential. This chapter shows you how to build and manage your team efficiently.

## Understanding Organisation vs Project Membership

There are two levels of membership in Tracker:

### Organisation Membership
- **What it means:** The person has an account in your organisation
- **What they can see:** Depends on their organisation role
- **Who manages it:** Organisation admins (typically Supplier PMs)

### Project Membership
- **What it means:** The person is assigned to a specific project
- **What they can see:** Only that project's data
- **Who manages it:** Project's Supplier PM

**The process:** First, invite someone to your organisation. Then, assign them to specific projects.

## Organisation Roles

When someone joins your organisation, they get an organisation role:

### Supplier PM
- Full administrative access
- Can manage all projects
- Can invite and manage team members
- Can access organisation settings
- This is typically for senior project managers and company leaders

### Org Admin
- Emergency backup administrator
- Full organisation access
- Doesn't actively work on projects
- Used for IT administrators or business owners who need access but aren't PMs

### Org Member
- Standard team member
- Access to assigned projects only
- Cannot manage organisation settings
- Most team members have this role

## Inviting Team Members

### Step-by-Step: Sending an Invitation

1. **Navigate to Organisation Admin**
   - Click your profile icon in the top-right
   - Select **Organisation Admin**
   - Click the **Members** tab

2. **Click Invite Member**
   - Look for the **+ Invite** button at the top of the members list

3. **Enter their details**
   - **Email address** - Must be valid; they'll receive the invitation here
   - **Full name** - How they'll appear in Tracker
   - **Organisation role** - Usually "Org Member" for most team members

4. **Click Send Invitation**
   - They receive an email with a link to join
   - The link expires after 7 days

[Screenshot placeholder: Invite member dialog]

### What the Invitee Receives

The invitation email contains:
- Your organisation name
- A link to accept and create their account
- Instructions for getting started

They need to:
1. Click the link
2. Create a password
3. Log in

Once they accept, they appear in your members list.

## Viewing and Managing Members

### The Members List

The Members tab shows everyone in your organisation:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Their display name |
| Email | Their login email |
| Org Role | Their organisation-level role |
| Projects | Number of projects they're assigned to |
| Status | Active, Pending (invited), or Inactive |

### Expanding Member Details

- Which projects they're assigned to
- Their role on each project
- Options to add or remove project assignments

3. A new invitation email is sent

[Screenshot placeholder: Resend invitation button]

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Invite with the minimum role needed** - You can always upgrade later
- **Use descriptive names** - "John Smith" is better than "John S"
- **Clean up unused accounts** - Remove people who have left the company
- **Check pending invitations** - Follow up if people don't accept within a few days

## Common Questions

**Q: Can someone be in multiple projects?**
A: Yes. Add them to each project with the appropriate role for that project.

**Q: Can someone have different roles on different projects?**
A: Yes. Their role is set per-project. They might be a Contributor on one and a Viewer on another.

**Q: What happens if I remove someone who has logged time?**
A: Their historical data (timesheets, expenses, comments) remains. Only their future access is revoked.

**Q: Can I see who's online?**
A: Tracker doesn't show real-time presence. Check the audit log for recent activity.

**Q: How many people can I invite?**
A: There's no limit on organisation members. Pricing may be based on active users - check your plan.

# Chapter 2.4: User Journeys - Organisation Setup

## Overview

This chapter presents three common scenarios for setting up organisations, showing how the features from chapters 2.1-2.3 work together in practice.

## Why This Matters

Real-world situations are rarely as simple as individual features. These user journeys show you how to handle common scenarios from start to finish.

---

## Journey 1: New Supplier Setting Up Their Organisation

### Scenario

Sarah is the Operations Director at TechDeliver Ltd, a software consultancy. They've just signed up for Tracker and need to get set up so they can manage their client projects.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Day 1: Creating the Organisation**

1. Sarah visits the Tracker sign-up page
2. She creates her account and enters the organisation details:
   - Name: "TechDeliver Ltd"
   - Type: Supplier
   - Time zone: Europe/London
3. She uploads the company logo
4. She's now the owner and sees an empty Dashboard

**Day 1: Basic Configuration**

5. Sarah goes to Organisation Admin → Settings
6. She configures:
   - Default currency: GBP
   - Working hours: 7.5 hours (their standard day)
   - Working days: Monday to Friday
7. She sets the primary colour to match their brand

**Day 2: Inviting the Team**

8. Sarah goes to Organisation Admin → Members
9. She invites her project managers:
   - Mike (mike@techdeliver.com) - Supplier PM role
   - Lisa (lisa@techdeliver.com) - Supplier PM role
10. She invites the finance team:
    - James (james@techdeliver.com) - Org Member role (will be Supplier Finance on projects)
11. She invites the delivery team (all as Org Member):
    - 5 developers
    - 2 designers
    - 1 business analyst

**Day 3: Verifying Setup**

12. Sarah checks the Members tab - most invitations are now accepted
13. She follows up with two people who haven't accepted yet
14. She creates a test project to verify everything works
15. She assigns Mike to the test project as Supplier PM to verify he can access it

### Outcome

TechDeliver Ltd is ready to go. They have:
- A branded organisation
- Correct working defaults
- A team of 12 people ready to be assigned to projects

### Tips from This Journey

- **Get your settings right first** - Before inviting people
- **Invite PMs first** - They can help test the setup
- **Create a test project** - Verify everything works before going live

---

## Journey 2: Adding a Customer to Your Organisation

### Scenario

Mike is a Supplier PM at TechDeliver Ltd. His client, Regional Bank, needs their project manager (Emma) to have access to review and approve deliverables.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Understanding the Requirement**

Mike needs to decide: Should Emma join TechDeliver's organisation, or should Regional Bank have their own organisation?

For this project, they decide Emma will join TechDeliver's organisation as an external member. This is simpler and gives her access to just what she needs.

**Inviting the Customer PM**

1. Mike goes to Organisation Admin → Members
2. He clicks **Invite Member**
3. He enters Emma's details:
   - Email: emma@regionalbank.com
   - Name: Emma Wilson
   - Organisation role: Org Member
4. He sends the invitation

**Assigning to the Project**

5. Emma accepts the invitation and logs in
6. Mike goes to the project's Team settings
7. He adds Emma with the role **Customer PM**
8. Emma now sees the project in her Dashboard

**Setting Expectations**

9. Mike sends Emma a quick email explaining:
   - How to log in
   - What she can see (project progress, deliverables, financials)
   - What she can do (approve deliverables, sign off milestones)
   - What she cannot do (edit the plan, approve timesheets)

### Outcome

Emma can now:
- View the project Dashboard
- See all milestones and deliverables
- Approve deliverables that need customer sign-off
- Approve variations (change requests)

She cannot:
- See other TechDeliver projects
- Access organisation settings
- Approve supplier timesheets

### Tips from This Journey

- **Customer PMs are often external** - They join your organisation but only see their projects
- **Use the Customer PM role** - It's designed for this scenario
- **Communicate clearly** - Tell them what they can and cannot do

---

## Journey 3: Managing a Growing Team

### Scenario

TechDeliver has been using Tracker for six months. They've grown from 12 to 35 people, and some people have left. Sarah needs to clean up and reorganise their team structure.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Auditing the Current State**

1. Sarah goes to Organisation Admin → Members
2. She exports the member list to spreadsheet
3. She identifies:
   - 3 people who have left the company
   - 5 people who were invited but never accepted
   - 8 new joiners who need to be added

**Removing Departed Staff**

4. For each person who has left:
   - She expands their row to see which projects they're on
   - She checks if they have any pending work (open timesheets, etc.)
   - She removes them from each project
   - She removes them from the organisation

**Cleaning Up Pending Invitations**

5. For the 5 unaccepted invitations:
   - 2 are for people who have left - she deletes these
   - 3 are for people still at the company - she resends the invitations and follows up by email

**Adding New Team Members**

6. Sarah invites the 8 new joiners:
   - 2 new project managers (Supplier PM role)
   - 6 delivery staff (Org Member role)

**Reorganising Project Assignments**

7. Sarah reviews each active project:
   - Checks team members are still relevant
   - Adds new PMs to projects they'll be managing
   - Ensures coverage for departed staff

**Documenting Changes**

8. Sarah updates the company intranet with:
   - Current list of Tracker admins
   - Process for requesting access
   - Who to contact for help

### Outcome

The organisation is now clean and up-to-date:
- No orphan accounts
- All pending invitations resolved
- New staff onboarded and assigned
- Clear documentation for future changes

### Tips from This Journey

- **Audit regularly** - Quarterly reviews keep things clean
- **Remove departed staff promptly** - It's a security best practice
- **Document your admin contacts** - So people know who to ask for access
- **Check pending invitations** - Follow up or delete stale ones

# Chapter 3.1: Creating a New Project

## Overview

This chapter walks you through creating a new project in Tracker, from the initial setup through to having a project ready for planning.

## Why This Matters

Every piece of work you manage in Tracker lives inside a project. Creating a project correctly sets the foundation for everything that follows - your plan, your team, your finances, and your reporting. Take the time to set it up right.

## Before You Create a Project

### What You'll Need

Have the following information ready:

- **Project name** - A clear, descriptive name
- **Project reference/code** - A short code for reports (e.g., "PRJ-001" or "ACME-2026")
- **Start date** - When work begins
- **End date** - When work is expected to complete
- **Customer name** - Who the work is for
- **Budget** (if known) - The financial value of the project

### Who Can Create Projects?

Only users with the **Supplier PM** role at the organisation level can create new projects. If you need a project created and don't have this role, contact your organisation's Supplier PM.

## Step-by-Step: Creating a New Project

### Starting the Creation Process

1. Click the **project selector** in the header (shows your current project name)
2. Click **+ New Project** at the bottom of the dropdown
3. The project creation wizard opens

[Screenshot placeholder: New project button in project selector]

### Step 1: Basic Information

Fill in the essential details:

**Project Name**
- Use a clear, descriptive name
- Include the customer name if helpful
- Example: "Regional Bank - Core Banking Upgrade"

**Project Reference**
- A short code for easy identification
- Used in reports and exports
- Example: "RB-CBU-2026" or "PRJ-047"

**Description** (optional but recommended)
- Brief summary of what the project is about
- Helps team members understand the context
- Example: "Migration of core banking systems to new platform, including data migration and user training"

[Screenshot placeholder: Basic information form]

### Step 2: Dates

Set the project timeline:

**Start Date**
- When work officially begins
- Can be in the future for projects not yet started

**End Date**
- Target completion date
- Can be adjusted later if needed

**Tip:** These dates define the overall project window. Milestones and deliverables will be scheduled within this range.

### Step 3: Project Type

Choose the project type that matches your engagement:

**Fixed Price**
- Customer pays a set amount for defined deliverables
- Budget is fixed regardless of time spent
- Common for: Implementation projects, defined scope work

**Time & Materials (T&M)**
- Customer pays for actual time and expenses
- No fixed budget ceiling
- Common for: Support contracts, ongoing work, undefined scope

**Internal**
- Work for your own organisation
- No customer billing
- Common for: Internal improvements, R&D, training

The project type affects which financial features are available and how reports are generated.

### Step 4: Customer Information

Link the project to a customer:

**Existing Customer**
- Select from customers already in your organisation
- Their details are automatically applied

**New Customer**
- Enter customer name and contact details
- They'll be added to your customer list for future projects

**Customer Contact** (optional)
- The primary person at the customer organisation
- Used for communications and reporting

### Step 5: Financial Settings

Set up the project's financial configuration:

**Currency**
- The currency for all financial values
- Defaults to your organisation's currency
- Cannot be changed after project creation

**Budget**
- The total project value
- For fixed price: The contract value
- For T&M: An estimated or capped amount

**Day Rate** (optional)
- Default billing rate for time
- Can be overridden per resource

### Step 6: Review and Create

Review all your settings:

1. Check each section for accuracy
2. Click **Create Project**
3. Wait for the project to be created (usually a few seconds)
4. You're taken to the new project's Dashboard

## After Creation: What's Next?

Your project exists but is empty. The next steps are:

1. **Add team members** (Chapter 3.4) - So people can access the project
2. **Configure settings** (Chapter 3.3) - Fine-tune how the project works
3. **Create your plan** (Part 4) - Add milestones, deliverables, and tasks

The Dashboard will show "No data" for most widgets until you add content.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use consistent naming** - Follow a naming convention across projects
- **Set realistic dates** - Allow buffer for the unexpected
- **Complete the description** - Future you will thank present you
- **Double-check the currency** - It can't be changed later

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I change the project name later?**
A: Yes. Go to Project Settings → General to rename the project.

**Q: Can I change the dates later?**
A: Yes. Dates can be adjusted in Project Settings. This won't automatically move milestones - you'll need to adjust those separately.

**Q: Can I change the project type later?**
A: This is not recommended as it affects financial tracking. Create a new project if the type needs to change.

**Q: What happens if I enter the wrong currency?**
A: Currency cannot be changed after creation. If wrong, you'll need to create a new project and transfer the data.

**Q: Can I copy an existing project?**
A: Yes - use project templates (Chapter 3.2) to copy structure from existing projects.

# Chapter 3.2: Project Templates

## Overview

This chapter explains how to use project templates to create new projects faster, how to save your own templates, and best practices for template management.

## Why This Matters

If you run similar projects repeatedly, templates save enormous amounts of time. Instead of creating the same milestones, deliverables, and structure from scratch, you can start with a template and just adjust the specifics. Templates also help standardise how your organisation delivers work.

## What is a Project Template?

A project template is a saved project structure that can be copied to create new projects. Templates can include:

- **Project settings** - Default configurations
- **Components** - Work areas or workstreams
- **Milestones** - Key checkpoints and phases
- **Deliverables** - Standard outputs
- **Tasks** - Common work items
- **RAID items** - Standard risks and assumptions

Templates do NOT include:
- Actual dates (these are adjusted on creation)
- Team members (you add these to the new project)
- Financial transactions (timesheets, expenses, invoices)
- Comments or history

## Using a Template to Create a Project

### Finding Templates

When creating a new project:

1. Click the **project selector** → **+ New Project**
2. Look for the **Start from Template** option
3. Browse available templates

Templates may be:
- **Organisation templates** - Created by your team for internal use
- **System templates** - Pre-built templates from Tracker

[Screenshot placeholder: Template selection screen]

### Creating from a Template

1. Select the template you want to use
2. The project creation form appears with template defaults
3. Modify any details as needed:
   - Change the project name
   - Adjust dates
   - Update customer information
4. Click **Create Project**

The new project is created with all the template's structure, but with your specific details.

### What Gets Copied

| Item | Copied? | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Project settings | Yes | Can modify during creation |
| Components | Yes | Structure preserved |
| Milestones | Yes | Dates become relative (e.g., "Day 1", "Week 4") |
| Deliverables | Yes | Linked to their milestones |
| Tasks | Yes | Linked to their deliverables |
| Standard RAID items | Yes | Common risks/assumptions |
| Team members | No | Add after creation |
| Historical data | No | New project starts fresh |

## Creating Your Own Templates

### From an Existing Project

The easiest way to create a template is from a project you've already built:

1. Go to the project you want to use as a template
2. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **General**
3. Click **Save as Template**
4. Enter a template name and description
5. Choose what to include:
   - Components and structure
   - Standard RAID items
   - Resource allocations (optional)
6. Click **Save Template**

[Screenshot placeholder: Save as template dialog]

### Template Best Practices

**Name templates clearly**
- Include the project type: "Software Implementation - Standard"
- Include scope level: "Small Project (<6 months)"
- Be specific: "Website Redesign - Full Service"

**Write good descriptions**
- What type of project is this for?
- What's included?
- What assumptions are made?

**Keep templates current**
- Update templates when your processes improve
- Remove outdated templates
- Review templates quarterly

### When to Create a Template

Create a template when:
- You've completed a successful project and want to replicate it
- You're starting a new type of work and want consistency
- Multiple PMs will run similar projects

Don't create a template when:
- The project was unique and won't be repeated
- The structure is still evolving
- You're not sure the approach is right

## Managing Templates

### Viewing Available Templates

1. Go to **Organisation Admin**
2. Click **Templates** tab
3. See all templates available to your organisation

### Editing a Template

1. Find the template in the list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Modify the structure, settings, or description
4. Click **Save**

**Note:** Editing a template doesn't affect projects already created from it.

### Deleting a Template

1. Find the template in the list
2. Click the action menu (three dots)
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

**Warning:** Deletion is permanent. Projects created from the template are not affected.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Start simple** - Your first template doesn't need to be comprehensive
- **Iterate** - Improve templates after each project
- **Standardise naming** - Use consistent milestone and deliverable names
- **Document assumptions** - Note what the template assumes about scope and approach
- **Version your templates** - Consider names like "Implementation v2.0"

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I share templates with other organisations?**
A: Templates are organisation-specific. Export and reimport would be needed to share.

**Q: How many templates can I create?**
A: There's no limit on templates.

**Q: Can I create a template from a template?**
A: Yes. Create a project from a template, modify it, then save as a new template.

**Q: What if I need to change the template after starting a project?**
A: Changes to the template don't affect existing projects. Modify the project directly if needed.

**Q: Can different people have different templates?**
A: Templates are organisation-wide. All Supplier PMs can see and use all templates.

# Chapter 3.4: Adding Team Members to Projects

## Overview

This chapter covers how to build your project team by adding members, setting their roles, and managing access throughout the project lifecycle.

## Why This Matters

A project is nothing without people. Getting the right team members with the right access levels ensures everyone can do their job effectively while maintaining appropriate security.

## Project Team vs Organisation Members

Remember the two-level structure from Part 2:

1. **Organisation members** - People in your organisation's Tracker account
2. **Project team** - A subset of those members who are assigned to this project

Someone must be an organisation member before they can join a project. If they're not already in your organisation, you can invite them as part of adding them to the project.

## Accessing Team Management

**From Project Settings:**
1. Go to **Project Settings** in the sidebar
2. Click the **Team** tab

**From Quick Add:**
1. Click the **+** button in the header
2. Select **Add Team Member**

## Adding Existing Organisation Members

If the person is already in your organisation:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Team**
2. Click **Add Team Member**
3. Start typing their name or email
4. Select them from the dropdown
5. Choose their **project role**
6. Click **Add**

[Screenshot placeholder: Add team member from organisation]

They immediately gain access to the project.

## Inviting New People to the Project

If someone isn't yet in your organisation:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Team**
2. Click **Add Team Member**
3. Click **Invite New Person**
4. Enter their email address and name
5. Choose their **organisation role** (usually "Org Member")
6. Choose their **project role**
7. Click **Send Invitation**

This does two things:
- Invites them to your organisation
- Adds them to this project once they accept

[Screenshot placeholder: Invite new person dialog]

## Choosing the Right Project Role

Assign roles based on what people need to do:

### Supplier PM
- **Who:** Your lead project manager
- **Can do:** Everything - plan, approve, configure, report
- **Typically:** 1-2 per project

### Customer PM
- **Who:** Client's project manager
- **Can do:** View everything, approve deliverables and variations
- **Typically:** 1-2 per project

### Supplier Finance
- **Who:** Your billing/finance team
- **Can do:** Approve timesheets, manage invoices, view financials
- **Typically:** 1-2 per project

### Customer Finance
- **Who:** Client's finance contact
- **Can do:** Review invoices, view financial reports
- **Typically:** 0-1 per project

### Contributor
- **Who:** People doing the work
- **Can do:** Log time, submit expenses, update tasks
- **Typically:** Majority of the team

### Viewer
- **Who:** Stakeholders who need visibility
- **Can do:** View everything, run reports
- **Typically:** Executives, PMO, auditors

## Managing Team Members

### Viewing the Current Team

The Team tab shows:
- All project members
- Their role
- Their email
- When they were added

### Changing Someone's Role

1. Find them in the team list
2. Click the role dropdown
3. Select the new role
4. Change takes effect immediately

### Removing Someone from the Project

1. Find them in the team list
2. Click the action menu (three dots)
3. Select **Remove from Project**
4. Confirm

**Note:** This removes project access only. They remain in your organisation and on any other projects.

### What Happens When Someone is Removed?

- They lose access to the project immediately
- Their historical data (timesheets, comments) remains
- They no longer appear in assignment dropdowns
- They won't receive project notifications

## Adding Multiple People at Once

For larger teams:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Team**
2. Click **Bulk Add**
3. Select multiple organisation members
4. Choose a role to apply to all
5. Click **Add Selected**

[Screenshot placeholder: Bulk add interface]

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Start with core team** - Add PMs and key contributors first
- **Use minimum necessary role** - Don't make everyone a PM
- **Remove promptly** - Take people off when they leave the project
- **Include stakeholders** - Add viewers for transparency

## Common Questions

**Q: Can someone be on multiple projects?**
A: Yes. Add them to each project with the appropriate role.

**Q: Can someone have different roles on different projects?**
A: Yes. Their role is set per-project.

**Q: What if someone's role changes mid-project?**
A: Just change their role in Team settings. It takes effect immediately.

**Q: Can I see who's on all my projects?**
A: Go to Organisation Admin → Members and expand each person to see their projects.

**Q: What happens to their work if I remove someone?**
A: All their contributions remain. Only their future access is affected.

**Q: Can I temporarily disable someone's access?**
A: Change their role to Viewer to restrict what they can do without removing them.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-03-04-001:** Add an existing organisation member to the project
- [ ] **UAT-03-04-002:** Invite a new person (not in organisation) to the project
- [ ] **UAT-03-04-003:** Change a team member's role
- [ ] **UAT-03-04-004:** Remove a team member from the project
- [ ] **UAT-03-04-005:** Verify removed member no longer sees the project

Every project is unique, but patterns emerge. These journeys show you how to set up different types of projects efficiently.

---

## Journey 1: Creating a Fixed-Price Project

### Scenario

Lisa is a Supplier PM at TechDeliver. She's just won a new contract to implement a customer portal for MegaCorp. The contract is fixed-price at £150,000 with delivery over 6 months.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Day 1: Creating the Project**

1. Lisa clicks the project selector → **+ New Project**
2. She fills in the basic information:
   - Name: "MegaCorp - Customer Portal"
   - Reference: "MC-CP-2026"
   - Description: "Implementation of self-service customer portal including design, development, testing, and deployment"
   - Start date: 1 February 2026
   - End date: 31 July 2026

3. She selects **Fixed Price** as the project type

4. She configures financial settings:
   - Currency: GBP
   - Budget: £150,000
   - Day rate: £650 (their standard rate)

5. She adds MegaCorp as the customer

6. She clicks **Create Project**

**Day 1: Configuring Settings**

7. Lisa goes to **Project Settings** → **Workflow**

8. She enables dual sign-off:
   - Milestone sign-off: Dual (Supplier + Customer)
   - Deliverable sign-off: Dual (Supplier + Customer)
   - This matches the contract requirement for joint approval

9. She enables timesheet approval (Required)

10. She goes to **Feature Settings** and enables Partners (they'll use a subcontractor)

**Day 2: Building the Team**

11. Lisa adds her team from the organisation:
    - Herself (already there as Supplier PM)
    - James (Supplier Finance) - for invoice management
    - Sarah (Contributor) - lead developer
    - Tom (Contributor) - designer
    - Anna (Contributor) - business analyst

12. She invites the customer stakeholders:
    - David (Customer PM) at MegaCorp
    - Finance contact to be added later

**Day 2: Communication**

13. Lisa sends David a welcome email explaining:
    - How to log in (he received an invitation)
    - His role (can view and approve, cannot edit plan)
    - What to expect next (she'll set up the plan)

### Outcome

Lisa has a fully configured project:
- Clear name and reference
- Correct financial setup (fixed price, £150K budget)
- Dual approval workflow matching the contract
- Full team with appropriate roles
- Customer PM onboarded and ready

### Tips from This Journey

- **Match workflow settings to contract terms**
- **Add the finance person early** - They'll need to set up invoicing
- **Communicate with customer contacts** - Don't assume they know Tracker

## Journey 2: Setting Up a Time-and-Materials Project

### Scenario

Mike is setting up an ongoing support contract for RegionalBank. They pay monthly based on actual time spent, with a monthly cap of £20,000. The work is expected to run indefinitely.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Creating the Project**

1. Mike creates a new project:
   - Name: "RegionalBank - Ongoing Support"
   - Reference: "RB-SUP-2026"
   - Description: "Ongoing technical support and maintenance for banking applications"
   - Start date: 1 January 2026
   - End date: 31 December 2026 (he'll extend later)

2. He selects **Time & Materials** as the project type

3. Financial settings:
   - Currency: GBP
   - Budget: £240,000 (monthly cap × 12 months)
   - Day rate: £550

**Workflow Configuration**

4. Mike configures simpler workflows since this is ongoing support:
   - Milestone sign-off: Supplier Only (no customer gates needed)
   - Deliverable sign-off: Supplier Only
   - Timesheet approval: Required (he'll review hours)

5. He goes to **Feature Settings**:
   - Disables Variations (no formal change control needed)
   - Disables Partners (no subcontractors)
   - Keeps RAID enabled (for tracking issues)

**Team Setup**

6. Mike adds a small team:
   - Himself (Supplier PM)
   - Two developers (Contributors)
   - Emma (Customer PM) at RegionalBank

7. He keeps the team lean - he can add people as needed

**Monthly Tracking**

8. Mike creates monthly milestones:
   - "January Support"
   - "February Support"
   - ... and so on

9. Each milestone will track that month's work and billing

### Outcome

A streamlined project for ongoing work:
- T&M billing matches the commercial arrangement
- Simplified workflows for support work
- Monthly milestones for billing cycles
- Minimal features enabled (no variations)

### Tips from This Journey

- **T&M projects need clear time tracking** - Timesheets are the basis for billing
- **Monthly milestones help with billing cycles**
- **Disable unused features** - Keep the interface clean
- **Set a reasonable end date** - Extend annually as needed

---

## Journey 3: Creating a Project from Template

### Scenario

Tom is setting up TechDeliver's third website redesign project this year. They've done this before and have a template.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Using the Template**

1. Tom clicks project selector → **+ New Project**

2. He clicks **Start from Template**

3. He browses templates and selects "Website Redesign - Full Service"

4. The form populates with template defaults:
   - Standard milestones: Discovery, Design, Development, Testing, Launch
   - Standard deliverables under each milestone
   - Standard RAID items (common website project risks)
   - Workflow settings (dual sign-off)

**Customising for This Client**

5. Tom updates the specific details:
   - Name: "FinanceFirst - Website Redesign"
   - Reference: "FF-WEB-2026"
   - Customer: FinanceFirst (new customer)
   - Start date: 15 February 2026
   - End date: 15 June 2026
   - Budget: £80,000

6. He clicks **Create Project**

**Post-Creation Adjustments**

7. The project is created with the full template structure

8. Tom reviews and adjusts:
   - Removes "Mobile App" deliverable (not in scope this time)
   - Adds "Accessibility Audit" deliverable (client requirement)
   - Adjusts milestone dates to fit the timeline

9. He adds the team:
   - Assigns developers and designer
   - Invites the client PM

**Time Saved**

Without the template:
- Creating structure: 2-3 hours
- Setting up workflows: 30 minutes
- Adding standard risks: 30 minutes

With the template:
- Total setup: 30 minutes

### Outcome

Tom created a fully-structured project in under an hour, including customisation. The template ensured:
- Nothing important was forgotten
- Standard approach was applied
- Project structure is consistent with previous website projects

### Tips from This Journey

- **Templates save significant time** - Especially for repeated project types
- **Customise as needed** - Templates are starting points, not rigid rules
- **Update templates** - After this project, Tom might update the template with the accessibility audit

# Part 4: Planning Your Project

---

# Chapter 4.1: Introduction to WBS Planning

## Overview

This chapter introduces the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) approach to project planning in Tracker, explains the hierarchy of components, milestones, deliverables, and tasks, and shows you how to access the Planner.

## Why This Matters

A good plan is the foundation of a successful project. Without a clear breakdown of what needs to be delivered and when, projects drift, deadlines are missed, and everyone becomes confused. The Planner helps you create a structured, comprehensive plan that everyone can follow.

## What is Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?

Work Breakdown Structure is a method of breaking down a project into smaller, manageable pieces. Think of it like an organisational chart for your project work:

```
Project
├── Component (e.g., "Backend Development")
│   ├── Milestone (e.g., "API Development Complete")
│   │   ├── Deliverable (e.g., "User Authentication API")
│   │   │   ├── Task (e.g., "Design authentication flow")
│   │   │   ├── Task (e.g., "Implement JWT tokens")
│   │   │   └── Task (e.g., "Write unit tests")
│   │   └── Deliverable (e.g., "Payment API")
│   │       └── Tasks...
│   └── Milestone (e.g., "Integration Testing Complete")
│       └── Deliverables...
└── Component (e.g., "Frontend Development")
    └── Milestones...
```

Each level adds more detail until you have specific tasks that people can work on.

## The Four Levels of WBS in Tracker

### Level 1: Components

**What they are:** Major work areas or workstreams within your project.

**Examples:**
- "Discovery & Design"
- "Backend Development"
- "Testing & QA"
- "Training & Rollout"

**Purpose:** Organise related work together. Components help you see the big picture and can be assigned to different teams.

### Level 2: Milestones

**What they are:** Significant checkpoints that mark completion of a phase or achievement of a goal.

**Examples:**
- "Requirements Signed Off"
- "Development Complete"
- "UAT Passed"
- "Go Live"

**Purpose:** Track major progress points. Often tied to payments or formal approvals.

### Level 3: Deliverables

**What they are:** Specific outputs that must be produced - the tangible things you're delivering.

**Examples:**
- "Requirements Document"
- "API Documentation"
- "Test Results Report"
- "Training Materials"

**Purpose:** Define exactly what you're producing. Deliverables are what get signed off by customers.

### Level 4: Tasks

**What they are:** Individual pieces of work that must be completed to produce a deliverable.

**Examples:**
- "Draft section 1 of requirements"
- "Review with stakeholders"
- "Incorporate feedback"
- "Final formatting"

**Purpose:** Break work into assignable, trackable units. Tasks are what team members actually do day-to-day.

## The Planner Page

### Accessing the Planner

1. Click **Planner** in the sidebar (Planning section)
2. The WBS planning view opens

[Screenshot placeholder: Planner page overview]

### Planner Interface Overview

The Planner shows your project structure in a hierarchical tree:

- **Left panel:** Tree view of all components, milestones, deliverables, and tasks
- **Right panel:** Details of the selected item
- **Toolbar:** Actions like Add, Edit, Delete, and view options

### Tree Navigation

- **Click** an item to select it and see its details
- **Click the arrow** to expand/collapse children
- **Drag and drop** to reorganise items (before committing)
- **Right-click** for context menu actions

### View Options

Toggle what you see:
- **Show Tasks:** Include or hide the task level
- **Show Completed:** Include or hide completed items
- **Collapse All/Expand All:** Quick navigation helpers

## Planning vs Tracker Mode

Tracker has two modes for managing your plan:

### Planning Mode (Before Commit)
- Full flexibility to add, edit, delete, and reorganise
- Structure is not locked
- Changes don't trigger variations
- Used for: Initial planning, restructuring

### Tracker Mode (After Commit)
- Structure is locked
- Major changes require variations (change requests)
- Progress can be tracked against the baseline
- Used for: Active project execution

You start in Planning Mode. Once your plan is ready, you "commit" to move to Tracker Mode. We'll cover this in Chapter 4.6.

## Planning Best Practices

### Start with Components
Begin by identifying the major workstreams. Don't worry about detail yet.

### Define Milestones Next
What are the key checkpoints? When do you need customer sign-off?

### Add Deliverables for Each Milestone
What must be produced to complete each milestone?

### Break Down Tasks Last
Only add tasks once deliverables are clear. You can add more tasks as you go.

### Use Consistent Naming
- Components: "Phase 1: Discovery", "Phase 2: Development"
- Milestones: "Discovery Complete", "Development Complete"
- Deliverables: "Requirements Document v1.0"
- Tasks: Start with verbs: "Create...", "Review...", "Update..."

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Don't over-plan initially** - Start with milestones and deliverables; add tasks as you begin work
- **Plan in iterations** - Your first plan won't be perfect; refine as you learn more
- **Involve the team** - They know what tasks are needed better than you might
- **Keep it manageable** - If a deliverable has more than 10-15 tasks, consider splitting it

## Common Questions

**Q: How detailed should my plan be?**
A: Detailed enough to track progress, but not so detailed it becomes a burden. Most deliverables have 3-10 tasks.

**Q: Can I change the plan after committing?**
A: Yes, through the Variations process (change control). Minor updates to tasks are always allowed.

**Q: Do I have to use all four levels?**
A: Components are optional if your project is small. Milestones and deliverables are essential. Tasks are recommended but optional.

**Q: Who can edit the plan?**
A: Only users with Supplier PM role can modify the WBS structure.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-04-01-001:** Access the Planner page from the sidebar
- [ ] **UAT-04-01-002:** Identify the four WBS levels in an existing project
- [ ] **UAT-04-01-003:** Expand and collapse items in the tree view
- [ ] **UAT-04-01-004:** Toggle "Show Tasks" and verify the view updates

# Chapter 4.2: Creating Components

## Overview

This chapter explains what components are, when to use them, and how to create and manage them in the Planner.

## Why This Matters

Components help you organise large projects into manageable sections. Without them, all your milestones appear in one long list. With them, you can group related work, assign different teams, and see progress by workstream.

## What is a Component?

A component is the highest level of organisation within your project plan. Think of components as major workstreams, phases, or work packages.

**Good component examples:**
- "Phase 1: Discovery"
- "Backend Development"
- "User Interface Design"
- "Data Migration"
- "Training & Change Management"

**When to use components:**
- Projects with distinct workstreams
- Projects where different teams handle different areas
- Projects longer than 3 months
- Projects with 10+ milestones

**When you might skip components:**
- Small projects (under 3 months)
- Simple projects with a linear flow
- Projects with fewer than 5 milestones

## Creating a Component

### Method 1: From the Planner Toolbar

1. Go to **Planner** in the sidebar
2. Click the **+ Add** button in the toolbar
3. Select **Component**
4. Fill in the component details:
   - **Name:** Clear, descriptive name
   - **Description:** What this workstream covers
   - **Start Date:** When work on this component begins
   - **End Date:** When this component should complete
5. Click **Save**

[Screenshot placeholder: Add component dialog]

### Method 2: Right-Click Menu

1. In the Planner tree, right-click on empty space or the project name
2. Select **Add Component**
3. Fill in the details
4. Click **Save**

## Component Properties

### Required Fields

**Name**
- Keep it concise but clear
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Examples: "Phase 1: Requirements", "Workstream A: Core Platform"

### Optional Fields

**Description**
- Explain what's included in this component
- Useful for team members unfamiliar with the project

**Start Date / End Date**
- The date range for this component's work
- Milestones within will be scheduled within this range

**Owner**
- Who is responsible for this component
- Usually a lead or senior team member

**Colour**
- Visual identifier on calendars and charts
- Choose distinct colours for different components

## Organising Components

### Ordering Components

Components display in the order you create them. To reorder:

1. Drag the component up or down in the tree
2. Release when in the desired position

**Tip:** Order components chronologically (Phase 1, Phase 2) or by team (Backend, Frontend).

### Nesting Components

Tracker supports one level of components - they cannot be nested inside each other. For sub-organisation, use milestones within components.

## Editing Components

1. Click the component in the Planner tree
2. The detail panel opens on the right
3. Edit any fields
4. Click **Save**

Or:
1. Right-click the component
2. Select **Edit**

## Deleting Components

**Before committing:**
1. Right-click the component
2. Select **Delete**
3. Confirm

**Warning:** Deleting a component deletes all its milestones, deliverables, and tasks.

**After committing:**
Components cannot be deleted without a variation (change request).

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use 3-7 components** - Too few doesn't help; too many is confusing
- **Name consistently** - "Phase 1:", "Phase 2:" or "WS1:", "WS2:" for workstreams
- **Match your team structure** - If separate teams handle different areas, make them components
- **Include end-to-end phases** - Don't forget "Testing", "Training", "Deployment"

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I move a milestone to a different component?**
A: Yes, before committing. Drag the milestone to the new component.

**Q: Do components have their own status?**
A: Component status is derived from its milestones. When all milestones are complete, the component is complete.

**Q: Can different people own different components?**
A: Yes. Assign an owner to each component for accountability.

**Q: What if I don't need components?**
A: They're optional. Create milestones directly at the project level for simple projects.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-04-02-001:** Create a new component with name, description, and dates
- [ ] **UAT-04-02-002:** Edit an existing component's properties
- [ ] **UAT-04-02-003:** Reorder components by dragging in the tree

# Chapter 4.3: Defining Milestones

## Overview

This chapter explains what milestones are, the different types of milestones, and how to create and manage them effectively.

## Why This Matters

Milestones are the heartbeat of your project. They mark significant achievements, trigger payments, and provide clear checkpoints for progress. Getting milestones right gives everyone clarity on what "done" looks like at each stage.

## What is a Milestone?

A milestone is a significant checkpoint in your project that marks the completion of a phase or achievement of a key goal.

**Characteristics of good milestones:**
- Clearly defined completion criteria
- Meaningful to stakeholders
- Represent genuine progress (not arbitrary dates)
- Often tied to payments or approvals

**Examples of milestones:**
- "Requirements Signed Off"
- "Development Complete"
- "UAT Passed"
- "Go Live"
- "Project Closure"

## Types of Milestones

### Progress Milestones

Mark completion of project phases without financial implications.

**Use for:**
- Internal checkpoints
- Technical completions
- Team handoffs

**Example:** "Technical Design Complete" - marks when design is done, but no payment is triggered.

### Payment Milestones

Trigger invoicing and are tied to commercial agreements.

**Use for:**
- Contractual payment points
- Deliverable acceptance gates
- Stage gates in fixed-price contracts

**Example:** "Phase 1 Complete" - when all Phase 1 deliverables are signed off, invoice for that phase's value.

### Setting the Milestone Type

When creating a milestone:
1. Check **Payment Milestone** if it triggers billing
2. Enter the **Milestone Value** (the payment amount)
3. Leave unchecked for progress-only milestones

## Creating a Milestone

### Step-by-Step

1. Go to **Planner** in the sidebar
2. Navigate to the component where this milestone belongs
3. Click **+ Add** in the toolbar or right-click the component
4. Select **Milestone**
5. Fill in the details:

**Name** (required)
- Clear, concise description of what's achieved
- Example: "Phase 1 Requirements Complete"

**Description**
- What does this milestone represent?
- What criteria indicate it's complete?

**Start Date**
- When work toward this milestone begins

**End Date** (Due Date)
- When this milestone should be complete
- This is your target date

**Payment Milestone** (checkbox)
- Check if this triggers a payment

**Value** (if payment milestone)
- The monetary value associated with this milestone
- Used for invoicing and budget tracking

**Owner**
- Who is responsible for ensuring this milestone is achieved

[Screenshot placeholder: Create milestone form]

6. Click **Save**

## Milestone Status Workflow

Milestones progress through these statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Not Started | Work hasn't begun |
| In Progress | Work is underway |
| Ready for Review | Deliverables complete, awaiting sign-off |
| Supplier Approved | Supplier PM has signed off |
| Customer Approved | Customer PM has signed off (if dual sign-off) |
| Complete | Fully approved and closed |

### Single Sign-off Flow
Not Started → In Progress → Ready for Review → Complete

### Dual Sign-off Flow
Not Started → In Progress → Ready for Review → Supplier Approved → Customer Approved → Complete

## Milestone Dependencies

You can link milestones so one cannot start until another is complete.

### Setting a Dependency

1. Select the milestone that depends on another
2. In the details panel, find **Predecessors**
3. Click **Add Predecessor**
4. Select the milestone that must complete first
5. Choose the dependency type:
   - **Finish to Start** (most common): B cannot start until A finishes
   - **Start to Start**: B cannot start until A starts
   - **Finish to Finish**: B cannot finish until A finishes

### Why Use Dependencies?

- Prevent work starting before prerequisites are complete
- Create realistic schedules
- Identify the critical path
- Highlight bottlenecks

## Editing Milestones

1. Click the milestone in the Planner tree
2. Edit fields in the details panel
3. Click **Save**

Or right-click → **Edit**

## Deleting Milestones

**Before committing:**
- Right-click → **Delete**
- Confirm deletion

**Warning:** Deleting a milestone deletes all its deliverables and tasks.

**After committing:**
- Requires a variation (change request)
- Cannot be directly deleted

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Make milestones meaningful** - Each should represent genuine achievement
- **Align with payments** - In fixed-price contracts, milestones often match payment schedule
- **Don't create too many** - 5-10 milestones is typical; more than 15 becomes hard to track
- **Include clear criteria** - What must be true for this milestone to be complete?
- **Set realistic dates** - Build in buffer for the unexpected

## Common Questions

**Q: Can a milestone span multiple components?**
A: No. Each milestone belongs to one component. If work crosses components, create milestones in each.

**Q: What's the difference between milestone end date and deliverable due dates?**
A: Deliverables under a milestone should complete before or on the milestone end date. The milestone date is the overall checkpoint.

**Q: Can I have milestones without deliverables?**
A: Yes, but it's unusual. Milestones typically contain the deliverables that prove the milestone is complete.

**Q: Who can mark a milestone complete?**
A: Depends on workflow settings. Usually Supplier PM, or both Supplier and Customer PM if dual sign-off is enabled.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-04-03-001:** Create a progress milestone with name, dates, and description
- [ ] **UAT-04-03-002:** Create a payment milestone with a value

# Chapter 4.4: Adding Deliverables

## Overview

This chapter explains what deliverables are, how to create them, and best practices for defining clear, manageable deliverables.

## Why This Matters

Deliverables are the tangible outputs of your project - the things you actually produce. They're what customers sign off on, what proves milestones are complete, and what team members work toward. Clear deliverables eliminate ambiguity about what "done" means.

## What is a Deliverable?

A deliverable is a specific output that must be produced as part of the project. It's something tangible that can be reviewed, approved, and accepted.

**Good deliverable examples:**
- "Requirements Document v1.0"
- "User Interface Designs"
- "API Technical Specification"
- "Test Results Report"
- "Training Materials"
- "Deployed Application"

**Poor deliverable examples (too vague):**
- "Do the requirements" (what exactly?)
- "Testing" (what's the output?)
- "Development work" (what are you delivering?)

## Deliverables vs Tasks

| Deliverables | Tasks |
|--------------|-------|
| Outputs you produce | Activities you perform |
| Get signed off by stakeholders | Get marked complete by assignee |
| Answer "What will you deliver?" | Answer "What will you do?" |
| Example: "Requirements Document" | Example: "Write section 3 of requirements" |

## Creating a Deliverable

### Step-by-Step

1. Go to **Planner** in the sidebar
2. Navigate to the milestone where this deliverable belongs
3. Click **+ Add** or right-click the milestone
4. Select **Deliverable**
5. Fill in the details:

**Name** (required)
- Specific and clear
- Include version if applicable
- Example: "System Requirements Specification v1.0"

**Description**
- What is this deliverable?
- What does it contain?
- What format (document, code, etc.)?

**Start Date**
- When work on this deliverable begins

**Due Date**
- When this deliverable should be complete
- Should be on or before the milestone end date

**Assigned To**
- Who is responsible for producing this deliverable
- Can be one person or left unassigned for now

**Acceptance Criteria**
- What must be true for this deliverable to be accepted?
- Bullet points work well
- Example:
  - All requirements captured
  - Reviewed by technical lead
  - Customer sign-off received

**Effort (optional)**
- Estimated hours/days to produce this deliverable
- Useful for capacity planning

6. Click **Save**

## Deliverable Status Workflow

Deliverables progress through these statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Not Started | Work hasn't begun |
| In Progress | Actively being worked on |
| Ready for Review | Draft complete, needs review |
| Supplier Approved | Supplier has signed off |
| Customer Approved | Customer has signed off (if dual) |
| Delivered | Complete and accepted |

### Understanding Sign-off

Depending on your project settings:

**Supplier-only sign-off:**
Not Started → In Progress → Ready for Review → Delivered

**Dual sign-off:**
Not Started → In Progress → Ready for Review → Supplier Approved → Customer Approved → Delivered

## The Deliverable Side Panel

When you click a deliverable, a detail panel opens showing:

- **Header:** Name and status
- **Dates:** Start and due date with inline editing
- **Assignment:** Who's responsible
- **Progress:** Percentage complete
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Checklist of requirements
- **Tasks:** Child tasks (covered in Chapter 4.5)
- **Comments:** Discussion thread
- **Attachments:** Related files

You can edit most fields directly in this panel.

[Screenshot placeholder: Deliverable side panel]

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria define what "done" means for a deliverable.

### Writing Good Acceptance Criteria

**Be specific:**
- Bad: "Document is complete"
- Good: "Document contains all 12 required sections as per template"

**Be measurable:**
- Bad: "Code works properly"
- Good: "All unit tests pass with >80% coverage"

**Be agreed:**
- Criteria should be accepted by both supplier and customer
- Don't surprise anyone at sign-off time

### Checking Acceptance Criteria

1. Open the deliverable
2. Find the Acceptance Criteria section
3. Check each item as it's met
4. All items must be checked before sign-off

## Editing Deliverables

1. Click the deliverable in the Planner tree
2. Edit in the side panel
3. Changes save automatically (or click Save)

Or right-click → **Edit**

## Deleting Deliverables

**Before committing:**
- Right-click → **Delete**
- Confirm

**After committing:**
- Requires a variation (change request)
- Cannot be directly deleted

## Tips and Best Practices

- **One deliverable = one thing** - Don't bundle multiple outputs
- **Use nouns** - Deliverables are things: "Report", "Document", "Design"
- **Include acceptance criteria** - Always define what "done" means
- **Size appropriately** - If it takes more than 2-3 weeks, consider splitting
- **Link to files** - Attach the actual deliverable when complete

## Common Questions

**Q: Can a deliverable belong to multiple milestones?**
A: No. Each deliverable belongs to one milestone. If something spans milestones, create separate deliverables for each phase.

**Q: What if I don't know all deliverables yet?**
A: Add what you know. You can add more later (before committing) or via variations (after committing).

**Q: Who signs off on deliverables?**
A: Depends on project settings. Usually Supplier PM, or both Supplier and Customer PM if dual sign-off.

**Q: Can I have deliverables without tasks?**
A: Yes. Tasks are optional detail. Small deliverables might not need task breakdown.

# Chapter 4.5: Breaking Down Tasks

## Overview

This chapter explains what tasks are, when to use them, and how to create and manage tasks effectively within deliverables.

## Why This Matters

Tasks are where work actually happens. They're the day-to-day activities your team performs. Well-defined tasks make work assignable, trackable, and completable. They turn abstract deliverables into concrete actions.

## What is a Task?

A task is an individual piece of work needed to produce a deliverable. Tasks are activities - things people do.

**Good task examples:**
- "Draft introduction section"
- "Review with technical lead"
- "Incorporate feedback"
- "Create wireframes for homepage"
- "Write unit tests for login module"

**Task characteristics:**
- Action-oriented (start with verbs)
- Assignable to one person
- Completable in hours or a few days
- Clear definition of "done"

## Tasks vs Deliverables

| Tasks | Deliverables |
|-------|--------------|
| Actions you perform | Outputs you produce |
| "Write the document" | "Requirements Document" |
| Assigned to individuals | Owned by someone |
| Marked done by assignee | Signed off by approvers |
| Often 1-8 hours | Often 1-3 weeks |

## When to Create Tasks

**Create tasks when:**
- You want to track detailed progress
- Multiple people work on one deliverable
- You need to sequence work within a deliverable
- Team members need clear daily assignments

**Skip tasks when:**
- The deliverable is simple enough to track as a unit
- One person handles the entire deliverable
- Adding tasks would be busywork

## Creating a Task

### Step-by-Step

1. Go to **Planner** in the sidebar
2. Navigate to the deliverable where this task belongs
3. Click **+ Add** or right-click the deliverable
4. Select **Task**
5. Fill in the details:

**Name** (required)
- Start with a verb
- Be specific
- Example: "Write executive summary section"

**Description**
- Additional details if needed
- Links to resources or guidance

**Assigned To**
- Who will complete this task
- One person per task is clearest

**Due Date**
- When this task should be complete
- Should be before the deliverable due date

**Effort** (optional)
- Estimated hours
- Helps with capacity planning

**Priority** (optional)
- High, Medium, Low
- Helps assignees know what to focus on

[Screenshot placeholder: Create task form]

6. Click **Save**

### Quick Add from Deliverable Panel

1. Open the deliverable side panel
2. Scroll to the Tasks section
3. Click **+ Add Task**
4. Type the task name and press Enter
5. Edit details by clicking the task

This is faster for adding multiple tasks.

## Task Status

Tasks have a simple workflow:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Not Started | Task not yet begun |
| In Progress | Work is underway |
| Complete | Task is finished |

### Marking Tasks Complete

1. Click the task
2. Change status to Complete

Or:
- Check the checkbox next to the task name

## Task Checklists

For tasks with multiple sub-steps, use the built-in checklist feature:

1. Open the task
2. Find the Checklist section
3. Add checklist items
4. Check them off as completed

**Example task:** "Prepare test environment"
**Checklist:**
- [ ] Provision test server
- [ ] Install dependencies
- [ ] Configure database
- [ ] Deploy test build
- [ ] Verify connectivity

Checklists show progress without creating separate tasks for small steps.

## Assigning Tasks

### Individual Assignment

Each task should have one assignee - the person responsible for completing it.

1. Open the task
2. Click the Assigned To field
3. Select a team member
4. Save

### Reassigning Tasks

Need to move a task to someone else?

1. Open the task
2. Change the Assigned To field
3. Optionally add a comment explaining why

The new assignee is notified.

## Task View Page

Besides the Planner, Tracker has a dedicated **Task View** page:

1. Click **Task View** in the sidebar
2. See all tasks in a filterable list
3. Filter by:
   - Assigned to me
   - Milestone
   - Component
   - Status
   - Due date

This is useful for team members who want to see their work without navigating the full plan.

[Screenshot placeholder: Task View page]

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use verbs** - "Create", "Review", "Update", "Test", "Deploy"
- **Keep tasks small** - 1-8 hours each; if longer, split it
- **One assignee per task** - Shared ownership means no ownership
- **Set realistic due dates** - Account for other work and interruptions
- **Don't over-task** - 3-10 tasks per deliverable is usually right

## Common Questions

**Q: Can a task belong to multiple deliverables?**
A: No. Each task belongs to one deliverable. If work spans deliverables, create separate tasks.

**Q: Do I need to create tasks?**
A: No, tasks are optional. Small deliverables might not need breakdown. But tasks help track progress.

**Q: Can tasks have subtasks?**
A: Not formally. Use checklists within a task for sub-steps.

**Q: Who can mark tasks complete?**
A: The assigned person or any Supplier PM.

**Q: What happens to incomplete tasks when a deliverable is signed off?**
A: Best practice is to complete all tasks first. Signing off with incomplete tasks is allowed but not recommended.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-04-05-001:** Create a task with name, assignee, and due date
- [ ] **UAT-04-05-002:** Add a checklist to a task
- [ ] **UAT-04-05-003:** Mark a task as complete

# Chapter 4.6: Committing Your Plan

## Overview

This chapter explains what it means to commit a plan, when to do it, what changes after committing, and how to make changes once committed.

## Why This Matters

Committing your plan is a significant moment. It transforms your project from "planning mode" to "execution mode". It creates the baseline against which you'll measure progress and triggers the formal change control process. Understanding commit implications helps you make this transition confidently.

## What Does "Commit" Mean?

Committing your plan means:

1. **Locking the structure** - Components, milestones, and deliverables can no longer be freely added, removed, or restructured
2. **Creating a baseline** - A snapshot of your plan for comparison
3. **Enabling change control** - Future structural changes require variations (formal change requests)
4. **Moving to execution** - The project shifts from planning to delivery

Think of it like signing a contract. Before signing, you can negotiate and change terms freely. After signing, changes require formal amendments.

## When to Commit

**Commit when:**
- Your plan is complete enough to start work
- Stakeholders have reviewed and agreed to the plan
- You're ready to baseline for tracking
- The customer expects formal change control

**Don't commit when:**
- The plan is still being developed
- Major elements are uncertain
- You haven't reviewed with key stakeholders
- You're still exploring options

## Before vs After Commit

| Aspect | Before Commit | After Commit |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Add components/milestones | Freely | Via variation |
| Delete components/milestones | Freely | Via variation |
| Restructure hierarchy | Freely | Via variation |
| Edit names/descriptions | Freely | Allowed |
| Edit dates | Freely | Allowed (tracks variance) |
| Add/edit tasks | Freely | Freely |
| Update status/progress | Yes | Yes |

**Key point:** Task-level changes remain free. Only structural changes (adding/removing milestones and deliverables) require variations.

## How to Commit

### Step-by-Step

1. Go to **Planner** in the sidebar
2. Review your plan thoroughly
3. Click the **Commit** button in the toolbar
4. Review the commit summary showing what will be locked
5. Add a commit comment (optional but recommended)
6. Click **Confirm Commit**

[Screenshot placeholder: Commit confirmation dialog]

### What Happens When You Commit

1. **Baseline created** - Current dates and values become the baseline
2. **Status changes** - Project status updates to indicate committed
3. **Structure locks** - Add/delete requires variations
4. **Tracking begins** - Variance reporting becomes available

## Working with a Committed Plan

### What You Can Still Do Freely

- Update task status and progress
- Add, edit, or delete tasks
- Update deliverable and milestone status
- Edit descriptions and notes
- Add comments
- Attach files
- Update progress percentages

### What Requires Variations

- Adding new milestones or deliverables
- Removing milestones or deliverables
- Moving deliverables between milestones
- Changing milestone values (payment amounts)
- Significant scope changes

### Minor Edits Allowed

You can still edit:
- Names (minor corrections)
- Descriptions
- Dates (system tracks the variance)
- Assignments

Date changes are tracked. If you change a milestone due date after commit, the system records the original (baseline) date and the new date, showing the variance.

## Making Changes After Commit (Variations)

When you need to make structural changes:

1. Create a **Variation** (see Chapter 5.6)
2. Describe what you want to change and why
3. Get approval (Supplier and/or Customer)
4. Once approved, the variation is applied

Variations provide:
- Audit trail of changes
- Approval workflow
- Impact assessment
- Baseline adjustment

## Baseline and Variance Tracking

After commit, Tracker tracks:

**Baseline dates:** Original planned dates at commit time
**Actual dates:** Current/updated dates
**Variance:** Difference between baseline and actual

This helps you answer: "Are we ahead or behind the original plan?"

### Viewing Variance

1. Go to **Milestones** or **Deliverables** page
2. Look for the variance indicator
3. Green = ahead/on track
4. Amber = slightly behind
5. Red = significantly behind

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Review thoroughly before commit** - You can't easily undo it
- **Get stakeholder agreement** - Make sure everyone's aligned
- **Document the baseline** - Note any assumptions or caveats
- **Commit at the right level of detail** - Don't commit an incomplete plan
- **Communicate the commit** - Let the team know the plan is now locked

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I uncommit a plan?**
A: No. Once committed, you can't revert to planning mode. Make changes through variations.

**Q: What if I committed too early?**
A: Create variations for necessary changes. Learn for next time.

**Q: Do I have to commit?**
A: For most projects, yes. Commitment enables proper tracking and change control.

**Q: When does baseline tracking start?**
A: Immediately upon commit. Current plan becomes the baseline.

**Q: Can I recommit/update the baseline?**
A: Baselines can be updated through approved variations or by creating a new baseline (see Chapter 5.5).

## UAT Checkpoints

# Chapter 4.7: Component Templates

## Overview

This chapter explains how to save components as reusable templates and how to import component templates into new projects.

## Why This Matters

If you deliver similar work repeatedly, component templates save significant time. Instead of rebuilding the same milestone and deliverable structure for each project, you can save a proven component and reuse it. Templates also help standardise delivery across your organisation.

## What is a Component Template?

A component template is a saved component structure that can be imported into projects. It includes:

- The component definition
- All milestones within the component
- All deliverables within those milestones
- All tasks within those deliverables
- Standard RAID items (optional)

It does NOT include:
- Specific dates (become relative when imported)
- Assignments (you assign after import)
- Historical data

## Saving a Component as Template

### When to Create Component Templates

Create templates when:
- You've built a component structure that works well
- You deliver this type of work repeatedly
- Multiple PMs could benefit from the same structure
- You want to standardise delivery methodology

### Step-by-Step: Saving as Template

1. Go to **Planner** and select the component to save
2. Right-click the component
3. Select **Save as Template**
4. Fill in the template details:

**Template Name**
- Clear, descriptive name
- Include the type of work
- Example: "Software Development - Standard Component"

**Description**
- What is this component for?
- What assumptions does it make?
- When should it be used?

**Include Items** (checkboxes)
- [ ] Milestones
- [ ] Deliverables
- [ ] Tasks
- [ ] RAID items

5. Click **Save Template**

[Screenshot placeholder: Save as component template dialog]

### Where Templates Are Stored

Component templates are organisation-wide. All Supplier PMs can use any template created in your organisation.

## Importing a Component Template

### Step-by-Step: Importing into a Project

1. Go to **Planner** in the target project
2. Click **+ Add** in the toolbar
3. Select **Import Component Template**
4. Browse available templates
5. Select the template to import
6. Review what will be imported
7. Click **Import**

[Screenshot placeholder: Import template selection]

### What Happens on Import

1. A new component is created with the template's structure
2. Milestones are created with relative dates (you adjust them)
3. Deliverables and tasks are created under each milestone
4. You can rename, adjust dates, and assign as needed

### Adjusting After Import

After importing, you'll typically:

1. **Rename the component** if needed for this project
2. **Set actual dates** - Template dates are relative; set real dates
3. **Assign team members** - Templates don't include assignments
4. **Customise** - Add, remove, or modify items for this specific project
5. **Review RAID items** - If imported, review for relevance

## Managing Component Templates

### Viewing All Templates

1. Go to **Organisation Admin**
2. Click **Templates** tab
3. Select **Component Templates** filter

### Editing a Template

1. Find the template in the list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Modify the structure or description
4. Click **Save**

**Note:** Editing doesn't affect already-imported components in projects.

### Deleting a Template

1. Find the template in the list
2. Click the action menu (three dots)
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm

**Warning:** Deletion is permanent. Existing projects with imported components are not affected.

## Component Templates vs Project Templates

| Component Templates | Project Templates |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| One workstream/component | Entire project |
| Import into existing projects | Create new projects |
| Mix and match multiple | One template per project |
| Reusable building blocks | Complete starting points |

**Use component templates when:**
- Different projects need different combinations
- You want to build projects from reusable parts
- Only part of a project follows a standard pattern

**Use project templates when:**
- The entire project follows a standard pattern
- You want one-click project creation
- Consistency across the whole project is important

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Name templates clearly** - Include the work type and scope
- **Document assumptions** - What must be true for this template to work?
- **Keep templates current** - Update when you learn better approaches
- **Start with proven structures** - Template what works, not what you hope works
- **Don't over-template** - Some flexibility is good

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I import multiple component templates into one project?**
A: Yes! Import as many as you need. This is the power of component templates.

**Q: What if the template doesn't quite fit?**
A: Modify after importing. Templates are starting points, not rigid constraints.

**Q: Can I share templates with other organisations?**
A: Not directly. Templates are organisation-specific.

**Q: Can I version templates?**
A: Not formally. Use naming conventions: "Development v1.0", "Development v2.0".

**Q: What if I import a template and then the template is updated?**
A: No effect. Imported components are independent of the original template.

# Chapter 4.8: User Journeys - Planning

## Overview

This chapter presents three common planning scenarios, showing how components, milestones, deliverables, tasks, and templates work together in real project situations.

## Why This Matters

Planning can seem abstract until you see it applied. These journeys show practical approaches to structuring different types of projects.

---

## Journey 1: Planning a Software Delivery Project

### Scenario

Sarah is a Supplier PM planning a 6-month software implementation for MegaCorp. She needs to structure the project from discovery through to go-live.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Day 1: Understanding the Scope**

Sarah reviews the contract and identifies the major phases:
1. Discovery & Requirements (6 weeks)
2. Design & Architecture (4 weeks)
3. Development (12 weeks)
4. Testing (6 weeks)
5. Deployment & Training (4 weeks)

**Day 1: Creating Components**

1. Sarah goes to **Planner**
2. She creates five components:
   - "Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements"
   - "Phase 2: Design & Architecture"
   - "Phase 3: Development"
   - "Phase 4: Testing"
   - "Phase 5: Deployment & Training"
3. She sets date ranges for each component

**Day 2: Defining Milestones**

For each component, Sarah adds milestones:

**Phase 1 milestones:**
- "Requirements Signed Off" (Payment: £30,000)
- "Stakeholder Buy-in Complete"

**Phase 3 milestones:**
- "Sprint 1 Complete"
- "Sprint 2 Complete"
- "Sprint 3 Complete"
- "Sprint 4 Complete"
- "Development Complete" (Payment: £60,000)

She sets dependencies: Development milestones depend on "Requirements Signed Off".

**Day 2: Adding Key Deliverables**

Under each milestone, Sarah adds deliverables:

**"Requirements Signed Off" milestone:**
- "Business Requirements Document"
- "Technical Requirements Specification"
- "Data Migration Requirements"

**"Development Complete" milestone:**
- "Application Code (Repository)"
- "API Documentation"
- "Release Notes v1.0"

**Day 3: Breaking Down Initial Tasks**

Sarah adds tasks to the first phase deliverables:

**"Business Requirements Document" tasks:**
- "Conduct stakeholder interviews"
- "Document current state processes"
- "Define future state requirements"
- "Review draft with business"
- "Incorporate feedback"
- "Obtain sign-off"

She assigns tasks to Anna (Business Analyst).

**Day 3: Review and Commit**

4. Sarah reviews the full plan with Mike (Customer PM)
5. They adjust some dates based on resource availability
6. Sarah clicks **Commit**
7. The plan is now baselined

### Outcome

Sarah has a comprehensive plan with:
- 5 components matching project phases
- 8 milestones including 3 payment milestones
- 24 deliverables across all phases
- ~60 tasks for the first phase (others to be detailed as work progresses)

### Tips from This Journey

- **Structure by phases** for sequential projects
- **Payment milestones align with contract** terms
- **Don't over-detail future phases** - add tasks closer to execution
- **Review with customer** before committing

---

## Journey 2: Creating a Phased Rollout Plan

### Scenario

Mike is planning a system rollout to five regional offices. The same implementation will happen at each location, staggered over time.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Understanding the Pattern**

Mike realises each office rollout follows the same pattern:
1. Site preparation (2 weeks)
2. Installation & configuration (1 week)
3. Data migration (1 week)
4. Training & go-live (1 week)

He'll create the structure once, then replicate it.

**Creating the First Component**

1. Mike creates component: "Region 1: London Office"
2. He adds milestones:
   - "London - Site Ready"
   - "London - System Installed"
   - "London - Data Migrated"
   - "London - Go Live" (Payment: £20,000)

3. He adds deliverables and tasks for each milestone

**Saving as Template**

4. Mike right-clicks the component
5. Selects **Save as Template**
6. Names it: "Regional Office Rollout - Standard"
7. Includes all milestones, deliverables, and tasks

**Creating Remaining Regions**

8. Mike clicks **Add** → **Import Component Template**
9. Selects "Regional Office Rollout - Standard"
10. Renames to "Region 2: Manchester Office"
11. Adjusts dates (2 weeks after London)
12. Repeats for Birmingham, Edinburgh, Cardiff

**Final Adjustments**

13. Each region now has identical structure
14. Mike adjusts dates so they're staggered
15. He assigns local leads to each region
16. He reviews dependencies (each region starts after previous completes)

**Commit**

17. Mike commits the plan
18. Five identical components, five payment milestones

### Outcome

A consistent rollout plan where:
- Every region follows the same proven process
- Changes to approach can be made to one template
- Progress is comparable across regions
- Total of 5 components with 20 milestones

### Tips from This Journey

- **Template repetitive work** - Create once, reuse many times
- **Stagger dates appropriately** - Account for travel, resources
- **Maintain consistency** - Same deliverables mean comparable quality
- **Consider dependencies** - Does Region 2 depend on Region 1?

---

## Journey 3: Using Templates to Standardise Delivery

### Scenario

TechDeliver wants to standardise how all their website projects are delivered. Tom is creating the organisation's standard component templates.

### Step-by-Step Journey

**Analysing Past Projects**

Tom reviews their last five website projects:
- What worked well?
- What was missed?
- What's common across all projects?

**Defining Standard Components**

Tom identifies four standard components for any website project:
1. Discovery & Strategy
2. Design & UX
3. Development
4. Launch & Handover

**Building the Discovery Component**

1. Tom creates a new project called "Template Development"
2. He adds component: "Discovery & Strategy"
3. He adds milestones:
   - "Discovery Complete"
   - "Strategy Approved"

4. He adds deliverables:
   - "Stakeholder Interview Notes"
   - "Competitor Analysis"
   - "User Personas"
   - "Content Audit"
   - "Project Strategy Document"

5. He adds standard tasks for each deliverable

6. He adds standard RAID items:
   - Risk: "Content not available on time"
   - Assumption: "Access to client CMS provided"

**Saving Component Templates**

7. Tom saves each component as a template:
   - "Website - Discovery & Strategy"
   - "Website - Design & UX"
   - "Website - Development"
   - "Website - Launch & Handover"

**Documenting the Templates**

8. Tom writes descriptions for each template explaining:
   - When to use it
   - What's included
   - What assumptions are made
   - What might need customising

**Communicating to the Team**

9. Tom presents templates at the PM team meeting
10. He creates a quick reference guide
11. PMs start using templates on new website projects

### Outcome

TechDeliver now has:
- 4 standard component templates for website projects
- Consistent delivery approach across all PMs
- Faster project setup (30 minutes vs 3 hours)
- Standard quality expectations

### Tips from This Journey

- **Base templates on experience** - Use what's worked
- **Document assumptions** - Not everything is obvious
- **Get team buy-in** - Templates work best when adopted
- **Iterate and improve** - Update templates after each project

---

# Chapter 5.1: The Dashboard

## Overview

The Dashboard is your project command centre. It displays key metrics, upcoming deadlines, recent activity, and AI-powered insights at a glance. Most project managers start their day here to quickly assess project health and identify items needing attention.

## Why This Matters

Without a centralised view, you'd need to visit multiple pages to understand project status. The Dashboard consolidates critical information so you can:
- Spot problems before they escalate
- Identify what needs attention today
- Track overall project health
- See team activity and progress

## The Dashboard Layout

### Header Section

At the top of the Dashboard you'll see:
- **Project name** and reference code
- **Overall health score** (0-100) with colour indicator
- **Quick stats:** Days remaining, budget status, completion percentage

### Main Content Area

The main area contains several panels:

#### Project Forecast Panel
Shows AI-generated predictions:
- **Completion forecast** - When the project will likely finish
- **Budget forecast** - Expected final cost
- **Velocity trend** - Whether progress is speeding up or slowing down
- **At-risk milestones** - Milestones that may miss their dates

#### Milestone Timeline
Visual representation of milestones:
- Past milestones (completed or missed)
- Current milestone (in progress)
- Future milestones (upcoming)

#### Recent Activity
Shows the latest actions across the project:
- Deliverables completed
- Time logged
- Documents uploaded
- Status changes

### Sidebar Widgets

The right sidebar contains focused widgets:

#### Anomaly Alerts
AI-detected unusual patterns:
- Timesheets with unusual hours
- Duplicate expenses
- Stalled deliverables
- Approaching deadlines

#### Approval Assistant
For users with approval permissions:
- Pending timesheet approvals
- Pending expense approvals
- Items recommended for approval
- Items flagged for review

#### Quick Links
Fast access to common actions:
- Log time
- Submit expenses
- View milestones
- Open calendar

## Understanding the Health Score

The health score (0-100) combines multiple factors:

| Score Range | Colour | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 80-100 | Green | On track, minimal concerns |
| 60-79 | Amber | Attention needed, some risks |
| Below 60 | Red | At risk, intervention required |

Factors affecting the score:
- Schedule variance (actual vs planned progress)
- Budget variance (actual vs planned spend)
- Milestone completion rate
- Open risk count and severity
- Overdue items

## Navigating from the Dashboard

Click any panel or widget to navigate to details:
- Click health score → Detailed AI analysis
- Click milestone → Milestone detail page
- Click anomaly alert → Affected item
- Click activity item → Related page

## Refreshing Dashboard Data

Dashboard data loads when you open the page. To refresh:
1. Click the **Refresh** button in the header
2. Or press **F5** / **Cmd+R** to reload the page

AI analysis runs on each refresh, so allow a few seconds for insights to update.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Check daily** - Make the Dashboard your morning routine
- **Address anomalies** - Don't ignore AI alerts; investigate early
- **Watch trends** - A slowly declining health score needs attention
- **Use quick links** - Save time on common tasks
- **Share the view** - Dashboard is great for status meetings

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my health score lower than expected?**
A: The score considers multiple factors. Click the score to see the breakdown. Common causes: overdue items, high-severity risks, or budget variance.

**Q: Can I customise the Dashboard layout?**
A: The layout is currently fixed, but widgets show/hide based on your permissions. Future versions may allow customisation.

**Q: How often do AI insights update?**
A: AI analysis runs when you load or refresh the Dashboard. There's no background processing; insights are generated on demand.

**Q: Why don't I see the Approval Assistant widget?**
A: This widget only appears if you have permission to approve timesheets, expenses, or deliverables. Viewers and Contributors don't see it.

## UAT Checkpoints

- [ ] **UAT-05-01-001:** Open the Dashboard and verify all panels load correctly
- [ ] **UAT-05-01-002:** Click the health score and view the detailed breakdown
- [ ] **UAT-05-01-003:** Click an anomaly alert and navigate to the affected item

# Chapter 5.2: Working with Milestones

## Overview

Milestones are the major checkpoints in your project. Once the plan is committed, you'll track progress against these milestones, update their status, manage customer sign-offs, and respond to baseline breaches when dates slip.

## Why This Matters

Milestones serve multiple purposes:
- **Progress tracking** - Where are we in the project lifecycle?
- **Payment triggers** - When payment milestones complete, invoicing can begin
- **Customer alignment** - Sign-offs confirm customer satisfaction
- **Contract compliance** - Contractual commitments tied to dates

## The Milestones Page

Navigate to **Milestones** from the sidebar to see all project milestones.

### List View

The default view shows milestones in a table:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Milestone name |
| Status | Not Started, In Progress, Complete, Signed Off |
| End Date | Target completion date |
| Baseline Date | Original committed date |
| Progress | Percentage complete |
| Value | Payment value (if payment milestone) |
| Component | Parent component |

### Filtering Milestones

Use the filter bar to focus on specific milestones:
- **Status filter** - Show only specific statuses
- **Component filter** - Show milestones in a component
- **Date range** - Show milestones within a period
- **Payment only** - Show only payment milestones

### Sorting

Click any column header to sort by that column. Click again to reverse the sort order.

## Milestone Status Workflow

Milestones follow a defined workflow:

```
Not Started → In Progress → Complete → Signed Off
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Not Started | Work hasn't begun |
| In Progress | Work is underway |
| Complete | Supplier considers work finished |
| Signed Off | Customer has formally accepted |

> **Note:** Only milestones with dual sign-off enabled require the Signed Off status. Otherwise, Complete is the final state.

## Updating Milestone Status

### To change status:

1. Open the Milestones page
2. Find the milestone you want to update
3. Click the milestone row to open the detail panel
4. Click the **Status** dropdown
5. Select the new status
6. Add a comment explaining the change (optional but recommended)
7. Click **Save**

### Status Change Rules

| Current Status | Can Change To |
|----------------|---------------|
| Not Started | In Progress |
| In Progress | Not Started, Complete |
| Complete | In Progress, Signed Off |
| Signed Off | (Final - cannot change) |

## Updating Milestone Progress

Progress percentage indicates how much of the milestone work is done:

1. Open the milestone detail panel
2. Find the **Progress** slider or field
3. Enter a percentage (0-100)
4. Click **Save**

Progress can be:
- **Manually set** - You enter a percentage
- **Auto-calculated** - Based on deliverable completion within the milestone

## Requesting Customer Sign-Off

For milestones requiring customer approval:

1. Ensure milestone status is **Complete**
2. Open the milestone detail panel
3. Click **Request Sign-Off**
4. The customer receives a notification
5. Customer reviews and either approves or requests changes
6. If approved, status changes to **Signed Off**

### What Customers See

Customers with sign-off permission see:
- The milestone details
- All deliverables within the milestone
- Option to **Approve** or **Request Changes**

If they request changes:
- Status reverts to **In Progress**
- You receive a notification with their feedback
- Address the feedback and re-submit

## Baseline Breach Warnings

When a deliverable's date exceeds the baselined milestone end date, a breach warning appears.

### Visual Indicators

Breached milestones show:
- **Warning icon** next to the milestone name
- **"At Risk" badge** in the status area
- **Breach reason** explaining which deliverable caused it

### Resolving Breaches

Option 1: **Adjust deliverable dates**
- Move deliverable dates back within milestone range
- The breach warning clears automatically

Option 2: **Create a variation**
- Formally extend the milestone end date
- Document the reason for the extension
- Get customer approval
- The new date becomes the baseline

> **Important:** Breaches don't automatically change anything. They alert you to a problem. You decide how to respond.

## Payment Milestones

Payment milestones have additional features:

### Value Tracking
- Shows the payment amount due on completion
- Contributes to project billing totals
- May trigger invoice generation

### Completion Requirements
Before marking a payment milestone complete:
- All linked deliverables should be complete
- Any required sign-offs should be obtained
- Documentation should be in order

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Update progress regularly** - Weekly at minimum
- **Don't mark complete prematurely** - Verify all deliverables are done
- **Add comments** - Explain status changes for audit trail
- **Watch baseline dates** - Track variance between actual and baseline
- **Prepare for sign-offs** - Ensure deliverables are ready before requesting

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I change a milestone that's been signed off?**
A: No, signed off is a final state. To make changes, you would need to create a variation.

**Q: What happens if I mark a milestone complete but deliverables are incomplete?**
A: You can do this, but it's not recommended. The milestone will show as complete even though work remains.

**Q: How does auto-calculated progress work?**
A: If enabled, progress is the percentage of deliverables within the milestone that are complete.

**Q: Can I delete a milestone after the plan is committed?**
A: No, committed milestones cannot be deleted. Use a variation to remove scope.

# Chapter 5.3: Managing Deliverables

## Overview

Deliverables are the tangible outputs your project produces. Managing deliverables means tracking their status, ensuring acceptance criteria are met, handling sign-offs, and keeping customers informed of progress.

## Why This Matters

Deliverables are what you ultimately deliver to the customer. Proper management ensures:
- Nothing falls through the cracks
- Quality standards are maintained
- Customer expectations are met
- Sign-offs are obtained for contract compliance

## The Deliverables Page

Navigate to **Deliverables** from the sidebar to see all project deliverables.

### List View

Deliverables display in a table showing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Deliverable name |
| Status | Draft, In Progress, Ready for Review, Delivered, Accepted |
| Milestone | Parent milestone |
| Component | Parent component |
| Due Date | Target delivery date |
| Assignee | Person responsible |

### Filtering Options

Filter deliverables by:
- **Component** - Focus on one workstream
- **Milestone** - See deliverables for a specific milestone
- **Status** - Find items in a particular state
- **Assignee** - See one person's deliverables
- **Overdue only** - Show items past their due date

## Deliverable Status Workflow

Deliverables follow this workflow:

```
Draft → In Progress → Ready for Review → Delivered → Accepted
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Defined but not started |
| In Progress | Actively being worked on |
| Ready for Review | Work complete, pending quality review |
| Delivered | Submitted to customer |
| Accepted | Customer has formally accepted |

> **Note:** The exact statuses available may depend on your project settings.

## The Deliverable Side Panel

Click any deliverable to open the detail panel on the right side of the screen. This panel provides:

### Summary Tab
- Status and progress
- Due date and baseline date
- Assignee
- Quick actions (change status, update progress)

### Details Tab
- Full description
- Acceptance criteria checklist
- Custom fields
- Linked documents

### Tasks Tab
- Tasks within this deliverable
- Task completion status
- Ability to add/edit tasks inline

### Activity Tab

- Audit trail

## Updating Deliverable Status

### To change status:

1. Open the Deliverables page
2. Click the deliverable row
3. In the side panel, click the **Status** dropdown
4. Select the new status
5. Add a note (optional but recommended)
6. The status saves automatically

### Quick Status Update

For rapid updates without opening the panel:
1. Find the deliverable in the list
2. Click the status chip directly
3. Select the new status from the dropdown

## Managing Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are checkboxes that define "done" for a deliverable.

### Viewing Criteria

1. Open the deliverable side panel
2. Go to the **Details** tab
3. See the acceptance criteria checklist

### Marking Criteria Complete

1. Click the checkbox next to each criterion as it's met
2. Progress updates automatically

### Adding Criteria (Before Baseline)

If the deliverable isn't baselined yet:
1. Click **Add Criterion** below the list
2. Enter the acceptance criterion text
3. Click **Save**

> **Note:** After baselining, acceptance criteria are locked. Changes require a variation.

## Requesting Deliverable Sign-Off

For deliverables requiring dual sign-off:

1. Ensure status is **Delivered**
2. Click **Request Sign-Off** in the side panel
3. Select the customer stakeholder to notify
4. Add any notes for the reviewer
5. Click **Send Request**

### Sign-Off Responses

The customer can:
- **Accept** - Deliverable is formally accepted
- **Reject** - Returns to In Progress with feedback
- **Request Changes** - Minor changes needed before acceptance

## Quality Assessment Panel

For deliverables approaching completion, an AI-powered quality assessment may appear:

### What It Shows
- Readiness score (percentage)
- Met and unmet acceptance criteria
- Potential concerns or gaps
- Recommendations for improvement

### Using the Assessment
This is advisory only. Use it to:
- Identify forgotten criteria
- Spot potential quality issues
- Prepare for customer review

## Bulk Operations

For multiple deliverables at once:

1. Use checkboxes to select deliverables
2. Click the **Bulk Actions** button
3. Choose an action:
   - Change status
   - Reassign
   - Update dates

> **Note:** Bulk operations respect permissions. You can only bulk-update items you have permission to change.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Update regularly** - Keep status current, not just at milestones
- **Use notes** - Explain status changes for context
- **Check criteria before delivery** - Ensure all boxes are ticked
- **Prepare supporting materials** - Have documentation ready for sign-off
- **Don't rush sign-offs** - Ensure quality before requesting

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I add deliverables after the plan is committed?**
A: No, new deliverables require a variation. You can add tasks to existing deliverables.

**Q: What if the customer rejects a deliverable?**
A: The status reverts to In Progress. Review their feedback, make changes, and resubmit.

**Q: Can I change the due date after baselining?**
A: Changes to baselined dates are tracked as variance. Significant changes require a variation.

**Q: Who can sign off on deliverables?**
A: Users with Customer PM role (or equivalent sign-off permission) can approve deliverables.

# Chapter 5.4: Task Management

## Overview

Tasks are the detailed work items that make up deliverables. The Task View page gives you a focused way to see, filter, and update tasks across your project without navigating through the WBS hierarchy.

## Why This Matters

While the Planner shows the full structure, Task View focuses on execution:
- See all tasks in one place
- Filter to find specific work
- Update progress quickly
- Identify blocked or overdue items

## The Task View Page

Navigate to **Tasks** from the sidebar to open the Task View.

### Layout

The page displays tasks in a flat list with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Task Name | Task description |
| Deliverable | Parent deliverable |
| Milestone | Parent milestone |
| Component | Parent component |
| Status | Not Started, In Progress, Complete |
| Assignee | Person responsible |
| Due Date | Target completion |
| Effort | Estimated hours/days |

### Filter Bar

Above the task list, filters help you focus:

1. **Component dropdown** - Select a specific component
2. **Milestone chips** - Quick filter by milestone
3. **Status filter** - Show tasks by status
4. **Assignee filter** - Show one person's tasks
5. **Show completed** - Toggle to include/exclude done tasks

## Filtering Tasks

### By Component
1. Click the **Component** dropdown
2. Select a component
3. Tasks filter to show only items in that component

### By Milestone
1. Click a **milestone chip** below the component dropdown
2. Tasks filter to that milestone
3. Click again to deselect

### By Assignee
1. Click the **Assignee** dropdown
2. Select a team member
3. See only their tasks

### Combining Filters
Filters work together. For example:
- Component: "Development" AND
- Milestone: "Phase 1" AND
- Assignee: "John"

Shows only John's Phase 1 Development tasks.

## Updating Task Status

### Quick Status Update

1. Find the task in the list
2. Click the status chip
3. Select the new status:
   - **Not Started** - Work hasn't begun
   - **In Progress** - Currently working on it
   - **Complete** - Finished

### From Task Detail

1. Click the task row to expand details
2. Click the **Status** dropdown
3. Select the new status
4. Add notes if needed

## Completing Tasks

When marking a task complete:

1. Ensure the work is actually finished
2. Update the status to **Complete**
3. The parent deliverable's progress updates automatically
4. Any task checklists should be fully checked

### Task Completion Impact

- Deliverable progress recalculates
- Milestone progress may update (if auto-calculated)
- Dashboard metrics refresh on next load

## Reassigning Tasks

To change who's responsible for a task:

1. Click the task row to expand
2. Click the **Assignee** dropdown
3. Select the new assignee
4. Optionally add a note explaining the change

The new assignee receives a notification.

## Task Effort Tracking

Tasks may have estimated effort:

### Viewing Effort
- The Effort column shows estimated hours or days
- Compare with actual time logged against the task

### Effort vs Actual
- Estimated effort is the plan
- Actual effort comes from timesheets
- Variance shows if tasks took more/less time than expected

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Start with filters** - Don't wade through hundreds of tasks
- **Use milestone chips** - Quick way to focus on current work
- **Update daily** - Keep status current for accurate tracking
- **Complete when done** - Don't leave finished work as In Progress
- **Check "My Tasks"** - Use assignee filter to see your own work

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I add tasks here or only in the Planner?**
A: You can add tasks to existing deliverables from Task View after the plan is committed. Click a deliverable row and use "Add Task".

**Q: Why can't I see some tasks?**
A: Check your filters. You may have a component or milestone selected that excludes some tasks.

**Q: Can I drag tasks between deliverables?**
A: No, task structure changes happen in the Planner or via variations. Task View is for execution tracking.

**Q: How does task completion affect milestone progress?**
A: If milestone progress is auto-calculated, it's based on deliverable completion, which in turn may be based on task completion.

# Chapter 5.5: Setting Baselines

## Overview

A baseline is a snapshot of your plan at a point in time. It captures dates, effort, and scope as they were when you "locked in" the plan. After baselining, you can track variance - how actual progress compares to what you originally planned.

## Why This Matters

Baselines enable:
- **Variance tracking** - See schedule and effort slip
- **Accountability** - Record what was agreed
- **Change control** - Know what changed from the original plan
- **Performance measurement** - Compare actual vs planned

Without a baseline, you're constantly updating a moving target and can't measure progress against the original commitment.

## When Baselines Are Created

Baselines can be created:

1. **At plan commit** - Automatically when you first commit the plan
2. **After variations** - When approved variations change the plan
3. **Manually** - When you want to reset the baseline (requires permission)

## Viewing Baseline Data

### On Individual Items

Milestones and deliverables show baseline information:

- **Baseline Date** - Original planned date
- **Current Date** - Current planned date (may differ after changes)
- **Variance** - Difference between baseline and current/actual

### On the Planner

In the Planner, you can toggle baseline view:

1. Click **View Options** in the toolbar
2. Enable **Show Baseline**
3. See baseline dates alongside current dates
4. Variance indicators highlight differences

### On Reports

The Variance Report shows:
- All items with baseline vs actual comparison
- Schedule variance (early/late)
- Effort variance (under/over)
- Summary statistics

## Understanding Variance

### Schedule Variance

| Situation | Indicator |
|-----------|-----------|
| Ahead of baseline | Green, negative days |
| On baseline | Grey, zero |
| Behind baseline | Red, positive days |

Example: "5 days behind baseline" means the current date is 5 days later than the original.

### Effort Variance

| Situation | Indicator |
|-----------|-----------|
| Under estimate | Green, negative hours |
| On estimate | Grey, zero |
| Over estimate | Red, positive hours |

Example: "10 hours over estimate" means actual effort exceeded the plan by 10 hours.

## Baseline Breach Detection

A baseline breach occurs when a deliverable's date exceeds its parent milestone's baseline end date.

### What Triggers a Breach

- Deliverable due date moved past milestone end date
- Actual completion date exceeds milestone end date
- Status changes indicate work extending beyond milestone

### Breach Indicators

When a breach occurs:
- The milestone shows a warning badge
- "At Risk" label appears
- Breach reason explains the cause

### Resolving Breaches

**Option 1: Bring dates back**
- Adjust the deliverable date to fit within the milestone
- Breach clears automatically

**Option 2: Extend the milestone**
- Create a variation to formally change the milestone date
- Document the reason for extension
- Get appropriate approval
- New baseline is set after variation approval

## Creating a Manual Baseline

In some cases, you may need to reset the baseline:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Baselines**
2. Click **Create New Baseline**
3. Enter a baseline name and description
4. Confirm you want to snapshot current dates as the new baseline
5. Previous variance data is preserved in history

> **Note:** This requires project admin permissions and should be used sparingly.

## Baseline History

View all baselines for a project:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Baselines**
2. See list of all baselines with dates
3. Click any baseline to see what was captured
4. Compare baselines to see how the plan evolved

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Baseline at commit** - Let the system create the initial baseline
- **Don't reset casually** - Baselines are for accountability
- **Use variations** - Formal changes should update baselines through variations
- **Monitor variance** - Catch slippage early
- **Explain variance** - Document why things changed

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I delete a baseline?**
A: No, baselines are audit records and cannot be deleted.

**Q: What happens to old baselines when I create a new one?**
A: They're preserved in history. You can view and compare any past baseline.

**Q: Does baselining lock the plan?**
A: Baselined items have restricted editing. Core fields like dates require variations to change formally.

**Q: Who can create manual baselines?**
A: Typically Supplier PM or project administrators.

# Chapter 5.6: Variations (Change Control)

## Overview

A variation is a formal change request that modifies the committed project plan. When scope, timeline, or budget needs to change after baselining, you create a variation to document the change, get approval, and update the plan properly.

## Why This Matters

Variations provide:
- **Change control** - Formal process for plan modifications
- **Audit trail** - Record of what changed and why
- **Approval workflow** - Stakeholder sign-off on changes
- **Contract alignment** - Document commercial implications
- **Baseline updates** - Properly adjust targets after approval

## When to Use Variations

Create a variation when:
- Adding new scope (milestones, deliverables)
- Removing scope from the plan
- Extending timeline significantly
- Changing commercial terms (milestone values)
- Modifying effort estimates substantially
- Responding to baseline breaches formally

Do NOT need a variation for:
- Minor date adjustments (a few days)
- Task-level changes (adding tasks to deliverables)
- Progress updates
- Status changes

## The Variations Page

Navigate to **Variations** from the sidebar.

### List View

The page shows all project variations:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Reference | Unique variation ID (e.g., VAR-001) |
| Title | Variation name |
| Status | Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Implemented |
| Type | Scope, Timeline, Commercial, or Mixed |
| Submitted | Date submitted for approval |
| Impact | Summary of changes |

### Filtering

Filter variations by:
- **Status** - See pending approvals or implemented changes
- **Type** - Focus on specific change types
- **Date range** - See variations from a period

## Creating a Variation

### Step 1: Start the Variation

1. Click **New Variation** on the Variations page
2. Enter a **Title** describing the change
3. Select the **Type**:
   - Scope - Adding or removing work
   - Timeline - Changing dates
   - Commercial - Changing values/costs
   - Mixed - Multiple types
4. Add a **Description** explaining why the change is needed

### Step 2: Define the Changes

Depending on variation type, specify:

**For Scope Changes:**
- Items to add (new milestones, deliverables)
- Items to remove
- Items to modify

**For Timeline Changes:**
- Items with date changes
- New dates
- Reason for extension

**For Commercial Changes:**
- Milestone value changes
- Budget implications
- Cost justification

### Step 3: Review Impact

The AI Impact Analysis panel shows:
- Schedule impact (days added/removed)
- Budget impact (cost changes)
- Scope impact (items affected)
- Risk assessment

### Step 4: Submit for Approval

1. Review all changes in the variation summary
2. Click **Submit for Approval**
3. Select approvers (typically Customer PM)
4. Add any notes for reviewers
5. Confirm submission

## Variation Status Workflow

```
Draft → Submitted → Approved/Rejected → Implemented
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Being prepared, not yet submitted |
| Submitted | Awaiting approval decision |
| Approved | Change accepted, ready to implement |
| Rejected | Change declined, no implementation |
| Implemented | Changes applied to the plan |

## Approving Variations

Users with approval permission see variations in their approval queue.

### To Approve:

1. Open the variation detail
2. Review all proposed changes
3. Check the impact analysis
4. Click **Approve**
5. Optionally add approval notes
6. Status changes to Approved

### To Reject:

1. Open the variation detail
2. Review proposed changes
3. Click **Reject**
4. Add rejection reason (required)
5. Status changes to Rejected
6. Submitter receives notification with feedback

## Implementing Variations

After approval, the variation must be implemented:

1. Open the approved variation
2. Click **Implement Changes**
3. Confirm you want to update the plan
4. The plan updates with all changes
5. Baseline adjusts to reflect new targets
6. Status changes to Implemented

> **Important:** Implementation updates the actual project plan. This is not reversible.

## AI Impact Analysis

The Impact Analysis panel uses AI to assess variations:

### What It Shows
- **Timeline Impact:** How dates shift
- **Budget Impact:** Cost changes
- **Risk Assessment:** Potential concerns
- **Dependencies:** Items affected by the change

### Using the Analysis
This helps decision-makers understand implications. It's advisory - humans make the final approval decision.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Document thoroughly** - Explain why the change is needed
- **Use the right type** - Helps with reporting and filtering
- **Review impact** - Understand ripple effects before submitting
- **Get buy-in first** - Discuss with stakeholders before formal submission
- **Implement promptly** - Don't let approved variations linger

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I edit a submitted variation?**
A: No, you must withdraw it, edit, and resubmit.

**Q: What if a variation is rejected?**
A: You can create a new variation with modifications based on feedback.

**Q: Can I implement partial changes from a variation?**
A: No, variations are all-or-nothing. Create separate variations for independent changes.

**Q: Who can create variations?**
A: Typically Supplier PM and Customer PM can create variations.

# Chapter 5.7: Using the Calendar

## Overview

The Calendar provides a visual timeline view of your project. See milestones, deliverables, and key dates on a calendar interface. It's useful for scheduling discussions, understanding workload across time, and identifying date conflicts.

## Why This Matters

Not everyone thinks in lists and tables. The Calendar helps you:
- See the big picture across time
- Identify clusters of work (busy periods)
- Spot date conflicts and overlaps
- Plan around holidays and events
- Share timeline views with stakeholders

## Accessing the Calendar

Navigate to **Calendar** from the sidebar. The calendar opens to the current month by default.

## Calendar Views

### Month View
Shows a traditional month calendar grid:
- Days of the week across the top
- Weeks as rows
- Items displayed on their due dates
- Click any day to see details

### Week View
Shows seven days in detail:
- More space per day for item details
- Better for busy periods
- Scroll horizontally through weeks

### Timeline View
Shows a horizontal Gantt-style view:
- Milestones and deliverables as bars
- Duration visible at a glance
- Useful for seeing overlaps

## What Appears on the Calendar

By default, the calendar shows:
- **Milestones** (with diamond markers)
- **Deliverables** (with square markers)
- **Key dates** (project start, end)

You can toggle visibility:
1. Click **Filter** above the calendar
2. Enable/disable item types
3. Filter by component or status

## Navigating the Calendar

### Move Through Time
- **Arrow buttons** - Previous/next period
- **Today button** - Jump to current date
- **Date picker** - Jump to specific date

### Zoom
- Switch between Month, Week, and Timeline views
- Each provides different detail levels

## Viewing Item Details

Click any item on the calendar to see:
- Item name and type
- Status and progress
- Due date
- Quick link to full detail page

## Colour Coding

Items are colour-coded by status:
- **Grey** - Not Started
- **Blue** - In Progress
- **Green** - Complete/Accepted
- **Red** - Overdue
- **Amber** - At Risk

## Exporting Calendar Data

To share calendar information:

1. Click **Export** above the calendar
2. Choose format:
   - **iCal** - Import into Outlook, Google Calendar, etc.
   - **PDF** - Static calendar image
3. Select date range
4. Download the file

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Check weekly** - Review upcoming items each Monday
- **Use filters** - Focus on specific components or statuses
- **Share exports** - Send calendar to stakeholders without Tracker access
- **Watch clusters** - Many items on one day signals planning problems
- **Timeline for overviews** - Best for executive presentations

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I drag items to change dates?**
A: No, the calendar is read-only. Change dates on the item detail pages or through variations.

**Q: Why don't I see tasks on the calendar?**
A: Tasks are excluded to avoid clutter. Use the Planner or Task View for task dates.

**Q: Can I add events to the calendar?**
A: The calendar shows project items only. Use your personal calendar for meetings and events.

**Q: How do I share the calendar with someone outside the project?**
A: Use the Export feature to create an iCal or PDF file to share.

# Chapter 5.8: RAID Log Management

## Overview

RAID stands for Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies. The RAID log is a structured way to track these items throughout your project. Proper RAID management helps prevent problems and ensures dependencies are managed.

## Why This Matters

RAID items are threats and constraints to your project:
- **Risks** - Things that might go wrong
- **Assumptions** - Things you're taking for granted
- **Issues** - Problems that have already occurred
- **Dependencies** - External factors you rely on

Tracking them systematically ensures nothing slips through the cracks.

## The RAID Log Page

Navigate to **RAID** from the sidebar.

### List View

RAID items display in a table:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Reference | Unique ID (R-001, A-001, I-001, D-001) |
| Type | Risk, Assumption, Issue, or Dependency |
| Title | Brief description |
| Status | Open, In Progress, Mitigated, Closed |
| Priority | High, Medium, Low |
| Owner | Person responsible |
| Created | When it was logged |

### Filtering

Filter RAID items by:
- **Type** - Risks only, Issues only, etc.
- **Status** - Open items, closed items
- **Priority** - High priority items
- **Owner** - Items assigned to specific people

### Views

Toggle between:
- **All** - All RAID items
- **Open** - Active items only
- **Mine** - Items assigned to you

## Understanding RAID Types

### Risks

**What they are:** Potential future problems that might occur.

**Example:** "Key developer might leave during critical phase"

**Fields:**
- Description of the risk
- Probability (High/Medium/Low)
- Impact (High/Medium/Low)
- Mitigation strategy
- Contingency plan

### Assumptions

**What they are:** Things you're accepting as true without proof.

**Example:** "Customer will provide test data by March 15"

**Fields:**
- The assumption statement
- Why it's being assumed
- What happens if it proves false
- Validation plan

### Issues

**What they are:** Problems that have already occurred and need resolution.

**Example:** "Integration API is returning incorrect data"

**Fields:**
- Issue description
- Impact on project
- Resolution plan
- Target resolution date

### Dependencies

**What they are:** External factors the project relies on.

**Example:** "Awaiting security approval from IT team"

**Fields:**
- What you're waiting for
- Who provides it
- Expected date
- Impact if delayed

## Adding RAID Items

### To add a new item:

1. Click **Add** on the RAID page
2. Select the **Type** (Risk, Assumption, Issue, Dependency)
3. Enter a **Title**
4. Fill in type-specific fields
5. Set **Priority** and **Status**
6. Assign an **Owner**
7. Click **Save**

### AI-Assisted Categorisation

When adding items, AI can suggest:
- Category (which type it should be)
- Priority based on description
- Probability and impact for risks

Click **Use AI Suggestion** to apply recommendations, or ignore and set manually.

## Updating RAID Items

### Status Workflow

```
Open → In Progress → Mitigated/Resolved → Closed
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Open | Identified, not yet addressed |
| In Progress | Actively being worked on |
| Mitigated | Risk reduced, issue controlled |
| Resolved | Issue fixed, dependency met |
| Closed | No longer relevant |

### To Update:

1. Click the RAID item row to open details
2. Update fields as needed:
   - Status
   - Priority
   - Owner
   - Notes
3. Changes save automatically

### Adding Notes

RAID items track history through notes:
1. Open the item detail
2. Click **Add Note**
3. Enter your update
4. Note is timestamped and attributed

## Managing RAID via Chat

You can manage RAID items through the AI chat assistant:

**Example Commands:**
- "Close risk R-001"
- "Update issue I-023 to In Progress"
- "Assign dependency D-005 to Sarah"
- "Resolve risk R-010 with note 'Vendor confirmed availability'"

The AI shows a preview before executing any changes.

## RAID in Variations

RAID items often drive variations:
- A risk materialises → Issue logged → Variation to address
- Assumption proves false → Scope change needed
- Dependency delayed → Timeline variation

Link RAID items to variations for traceability.

## RAID Reports

View RAID summary reports:
1. Go to **Reports** → **RAID Summary**
2. See counts by type and status
3. View aging (how long items have been open)
4. Identify owners with most items

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Log early** - Capture RAID items as soon as identified
- **Review regularly** - Weekly RAID review is standard practice
- **Assign owners** - Every item needs someone accountable
- **Update status** - Keep status current; closed items matter too
- **Link to actions** - RAID items should drive action, not just documentation

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between a Risk and an Issue?**
A: A risk is something that might happen. An issue is something that has happened.

**Q: Can I delete RAID items?**
A: No, RAID items are audit records. Close them instead when no longer relevant.

**Q: Who should own RAID items?**
A: The person best positioned to manage or monitor them - not necessarily the PM.

**Q: How often should we review the RAID log?**
A: Weekly review is typical for active projects.

# Chapter 5.9: User Journeys - Project Execution

This chapter provides three practical scenarios showing how features work together during project execution.

---

## Journey 1: A Typical Week for a Supplier PM

### Scenario

Lisa is the Supplier PM for a 6-month software delivery project. Let's follow her typical Monday morning routine.

### Monday Morning: Dashboard Review

1. Lisa logs into Tracker and opens the Dashboard
2. She checks the **health score** - currently 78 (amber)
3. The **anomaly alerts** show 3 items:
   - Timesheet with unusually high hours (32 hours on Saturday)
   - Deliverable "API Documentation" is 5 days overdue
   - Milestone "Development Complete" is approaching (7 days)
4. She clicks the timesheet alert - it's a contractor who worked overtime on critical integration work
5. She notes to verify this in the approval queue

### Checking Milestones

1. Lisa opens **Milestones** and filters to "In Progress"
2. The current milestone "Development Complete" shows 75% progress
3. She notices a **baseline breach warning** on one deliverable
4. Clicking through, she sees "API Integration" was extended by 3 days
5. The deliverable date now exceeds the milestone end date
6. She decides this needs a variation to formally extend

### Creating a Variation

1. Lisa opens **Variations** and clicks **New Variation**
2. Title: "Development milestone extension - API complexity"
3. Type: Timeline
4. She documents:
   - The API integration proved more complex than estimated
   - 3 additional days needed
   - No budget impact (team absorption)
5. She reviews the AI impact analysis
6. She submits for customer approval

### RAID Review

1. Lisa opens the **RAID** log
2. She filters to "Open" items
3. She reviews each:
   - Risk R-008 "Data migration complexity" - Still valid, monitoring
   - Issue I-015 "Test environment unstable" - Mark In Progress, add note that IT is investigating
   - Dependency D-003 "Customer test data" - Due this week, send reminder
4. She adds a new risk: "Key developer annual leave during testing phase"

### Timesheet Approvals

1. Lisa opens her **Approval queue**
2. The AI Approval Assistant shows:
   - 12 timesheets recommended for approval
   - 2 timesheets flagged for review
3. One flagged is the 32-hour Saturday entry
4. She reviews - the contractor has a note explaining critical deadline work
5. She approves all timesheets with the overtime explanation noted

### Outcome

In 30 minutes, Lisa has:
- Understood project health status
- Identified a timeline issue and created formal change request
- Updated RAID items
- Processed timesheet approvals

### Tips from This Journey

- **Start with Dashboard** - Quick health check before diving in
- **Address anomalies** - Don't ignore AI alerts
- **Formalise changes** - Use variations for timeline shifts
- **Keep RAID current** - Regular review prevents surprises

# Part 6: Financial Management

Financial management is critical to project success. This part covers how to track time, manage expenses, set up billing profiles, work with partners, and manage project resources. Proper financial tracking ensures accurate billing, cost control, and project profitability.

---

# Chapter 6.1: Timesheets

## Overview

Timesheets capture time spent on project work. Team members log their hours, submit for approval, and managers review and approve. Accurate timesheets are essential for billing, cost tracking, and understanding where effort is being spent.

## Why This Matters

Timesheets serve multiple purposes:
- **Billing** - Time-and-materials projects bill based on logged hours
- **Cost tracking** - Understand actual vs estimated effort
- **Resource utilisation** - See how team members are spending time
- **Project health** - Identify areas consuming more effort than planned

## The Timesheets Page

Navigate to **Timesheets** from the sidebar.

### Views Available

| View | Who Sees It | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| My Timesheets | Everyone | Log and manage your own time |
| Team Timesheets | Managers | View team member timesheets |
| Approvals | Approvers | Review and approve submissions |

### My Timesheets View

Shows your time entries organised by week:
- Current week displayed by default
- Navigate to past weeks using arrows
- See daily totals and weekly total
- Submit button when ready for approval

## Logging Time

### Creating a Time Entry

1. Open **Timesheets** → **My Timesheets**
2. Navigate to the correct week
3. Click on a day cell or **Add Entry**
4. Fill in the entry form:
   - **Date** - Defaults to selected day
   - **Hours** - Time spent (0.25 increments)
   - **Milestone** - Which milestone the work relates to
   - **Deliverable** - Specific deliverable (optional)
   - **Task** - Specific task (optional)
   - **Description** - What you worked on
5. Click **Save**

### Quick Entry Mode

For faster logging:
1. Click directly in a day cell
2. Enter hours
3. Select milestone from dropdown
4. Press Enter to save

### Copying Previous Entries

If your work is similar week to week:

## Time Entry Rules

### Minimum/Maximum Hours

Projects may have rules:
- Minimum hours per entry (e.g., 0.25)
- Maximum hours per day (e.g., 12)
- Maximum hours per week (e.g., 45)

The system warns if you exceed limits.

### Required Fields

Depending on project settings:
- Milestone may be required
- Description may be required
- Task selection may be required

### Billable vs Non-Billable

Entries can be marked:
- **Billable** - Charged to the customer
- **Non-billable** - Internal time, not charged

Non-billable time still tracks effort but doesn't affect billing.

## Submitting Timesheets

### When to Submit

Submit timesheets when:
- The week is complete
- You've verified all entries are accurate
- Description text explains the work

### How to Submit

1. Review all entries for the week
2. Ensure hours are correct
3. Click **Submit for Approval**
4. Confirm the submission
5. Status changes to "Submitted"

### What Happens After Submission

- Entries become read-only (cannot edit)
- Approvers receive notification
- You can track approval status

### Using AI to Submit

Via the chat assistant:
1. Open the chat
2. Say "Submit my timesheets" or "Submit timesheets for this week"
3. AI shows preview: "You have 3 timesheets totaling 24 hours"
4. Confirm with "Yes" or "Confirm"
5. AI submits and confirms success

## Timesheet Status Workflow

```
Draft → Submitted → Approved/Rejected
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Being prepared, can edit |
| Submitted | Awaiting approval, read-only |
| Approved | Accepted, ready for billing |
| Rejected | Returned with feedback, can edit and resubmit |

## Editing and Corrections

### Before Submission

- Edit entries freely
- Delete entries if needed
- Add new entries anytime

### After Submission (Rejected)

If an approver rejects your timesheet:
1. You receive notification with feedback
2. Status reverts to Draft
3. Make corrections
4. Resubmit

### After Approval

Approved timesheets cannot be edited. If corrections are needed:
1. Contact your manager
2. They may need to reverse the approval
3. Or create an adjustment entry

## Viewing Time Reports

See summaries of your logged time:

1. Click **Reports** in the timesheet view
2. Select date range
3. View by:
   - Milestone
   - Deliverable
   - Day/Week/Month

Export options:
- CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- PDF for records

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Log daily** - Don't wait until Friday; details fade
- **Be specific** - Good descriptions help approvers and future reference
- **Check totals** - Verify hours before submitting
- **Use milestones** - Proper categorisation helps reporting
- **Submit on time** - Don't delay; it holds up billing

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I log time to multiple projects?**
A: Yes, switch projects using the project selector. Each project has its own timesheets.

**Q: What if I forget to log time for a past week?**
A: Navigate to that week and add entries. You can log time retroactively, though some projects may have cut-off dates.

**Q: Can I see how much time the whole team has logged?**
A: Managers can view team timesheets. Contributors see only their own.

**Q: What happens to approved timesheets?**
A: They feed into billing and reporting. The hours become part of the project's actual cost.

# Chapter 6.3: Finance Profiles

## Overview

Finance profiles define billing arrangements for projects. They specify rates, billing terms, and how time and expenses are converted into invoices. Setting up finance profiles correctly ensures accurate billing and revenue recognition.

## Why This Matters

Finance profiles control:
- **Rate cards** - What rates apply to different roles
- **Billing terms** - When and how to invoice
- **Revenue tracking** - How income is recognised
- **Cost calculation** - How project costs are computed

## Understanding Finance Profiles

### What They Contain

A finance profile includes:
- **Profile name** - Identifies the billing arrangement
- **Rate card** - Rates for each role/grade
- **Currency** - Billing currency
- **Billing frequency** - Monthly, milestone-based, etc.
- **Payment terms** - Days until payment due

### Profile Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Time & Materials | Bill actual hours at agreed rates | Ongoing support, advisory work |
| Fixed Price | Bill against milestones | Defined deliverable projects |
| Hybrid | Mix of T&M and fixed elements | Complex engagements |

## Viewing Finance Profiles

### At Organisation Level

1. Go to **Organisation Admin** → **Finance**
2. See all finance profiles available
3. These are templates for projects

### At Project Level

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Finance**
2. See the profile assigned to this project
3. View effective rates and terms

## Creating a Finance Profile (Org Admin)

### Step 1: Start New Profile

1. Go to **Organisation Admin** → **Finance**
2. Click **New Finance Profile**
3. Enter a **Profile Name** (e.g., "Standard T&M Rates 2026")

### Step 2: Configure Rate Card

Add rates for each role:

| Role | Day Rate | Hourly Rate |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Senior Consultant | $1,600 | $200 |
| Consultant | $1,200 | $150 |
| Analyst | $800 | $100 |

For each rate:
1. Click **Add Rate**
2. Select or enter the role/grade
3. Enter day rate and/or hourly rate
4. Specify currency

### Step 3: Set Billing Terms

Configure billing frequency:
- **Monthly** - Invoice at month end
- **Milestone** - Invoice when milestones complete
- **Weekly** - Invoice weekly
- **On Demand** - Manual invoice generation

Payment terms:
- Net 30, Net 45, Net 60, etc.
- Due on receipt

### Step 4: Save Profile

Review settings and click **Save**.

## Assigning Profiles to Projects

### When Creating a Project

1. During project creation, select **Finance Profile**
2. Choose from available profiles
3. Profile settings apply to the project

### Changing Project Profile

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Finance**
2. Click **Change Profile**
3. Select new profile
4. Confirm the change

> **Note:** Changing profiles affects future billing, not past invoices.

## Rate Overrides

Sometimes project-specific rates differ from the profile:

### Creating an Override

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Finance** → **Rate Overrides**
2. Click **Add Override**
3. Select the role
4. Enter the project-specific rate
5. Save

### When Overrides Apply

- Overrides take precedence over profile rates
- Only affect this project
- Useful for negotiated discounts or special rates

## Viewing Billing Summary

See how logged time translates to billing:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Finance** → **Billing Summary**
2. View by period (month, week)
3. See:
   - Hours logged by role
   - Rates applied
   - Total billable amount
   - Non-billable time

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Standardise profiles** - Use consistent profiles across similar projects
- **Document rates** - Keep records of agreed rates
- **Review regularly** - Update rates annually
- **Use overrides sparingly** - Prefer standard profiles when possible
- **Check before billing** - Verify rates before generating invoices

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I have multiple profiles for one project?**
A: No, each project has one active finance profile. Use rate overrides for variations.

**Q: What happens if I change a rate mid-project?**
A: Changes apply to future time entries. Past entries use the rate at time of logging.

**Q: Can customers see the finance profile?**
A: Customers see agreed rates in contracts but typically don't access internal profile settings.

**Q: How do fixed-price projects use profiles?**
A: Fixed-price projects still use profiles for internal cost tracking, even if billing is milestone-based.

# Chapter 6.4: Partners and Partner Invoicing

## Overview

Partners are external organisations that contribute to your projects - subcontractors, consultants, or vendors. Partner invoicing tracks what they bill you, ensuring you can pass costs through to customers or account for them in project finances.

## Why This Matters

Partner management ensures:
- **Cost tracking** - Know what partners charge
- **Pass-through billing** - Invoice customers for partner costs
- **Margin protection** - Monitor partner costs against budget
- **Vendor management** - Track partner performance

## Understanding Partners

### Who Are Partners?

Partners are external entities:
- Subcontractor companies
- Freelance consultants
- Specialist vendors
- Technology providers

### Partner vs Team Member

| Aspect | Team Member | Partner |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Employment | Internal or assigned | External company |
| Time logging | Uses Timesheets | Submits invoices |
| Payment | Through payroll | Through accounts payable |
| Rates | From finance profile | Negotiated separately |

## The Partners Page

Navigate to **Partners** from the sidebar (if enabled for your project).

### Partner List

Shows all partners on the project:

   - **Amount** - Total invoice amount
4. Add line items:
   - Description
   - Amount
   - Milestone (optional)
5. Attach the invoice document (PDF)
6. Click **Save**

### Invoice Status Workflow

```
Draft → Submitted → Approved → Paid
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Being entered |
| Submitted | Ready for review |
| Approved | Accepted for payment |
| Paid | Payment made |

### Approving Partner Invoices

1. Review invoice details
2. Verify against contract/PO
3. Check amounts and dates
4. Click **Approve**
5. Invoice moves to accounts payable

## Pass-Through Billing

When partner costs are billed to customers:

### Marking as Billable

1. When creating the invoice, enable **Billable to Customer**
2. Set markup percentage (if applicable)
3. Partner cost appears in customer billing

### Cost Plus Markup

Example:
- Partner invoice: $10,000
- Markup: 15%
- Customer charge: $11,500

## Tracking Partner Costs

### By Partner

View total spend per partner:
1. Go to **Partners**

3. Click partner for detail

### By Milestone

See partner costs allocated to milestones:
1. Go to **Finance** → **Cost Breakdown**
2. Filter by cost type: Partner
3. View by milestone

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Enter invoices promptly** - Don't let them pile up
- **Attach documents** - Keep invoice PDFs with records
- **Match to contracts** - Verify rates and quantities
- **Track by milestone** - Allocate costs for accurate reporting
- **Monitor totals** - Watch partner spend against budget

## Common Questions

**Q: Can partners log time directly?**
A: No, partners submit invoices. They don't use the timesheet system.

**Q: What's the difference between partner invoice and customer invoice?**
A: Partner invoices are what partners charge you. Customer invoices are what you charge customers.

**Q: Can I reject a partner invoice?**
A: Yes, you can reject with feedback. The partner would then submit a corrected invoice.

**Q: How do partner costs affect project profitability?**
A: Partner costs are part of project cost. Revenue minus (labour + partner + other costs) = margin.

1. Click **Add Resource** on the Resources page
2. Search for existing organisation member
3. Or invite new person
4. Set their project role
5. Set allocation dates and percentage
6. Click **Add**

## Resource Allocation

### Understanding Allocation

Allocation is the percentage of time a person dedicates to this project:
- 100% = Full time
- 50% = Half time
- 20% = One day per week

### Setting Allocation

1. Click a resource to edit
2. Set **Allocation %**
3. Set **Start Date** and **End Date**
4. Save changes

### Allocation vs Actual

- **Allocation** is planned capacity
- **Timesheets** show actual time spent
- Compare to identify over/under utilisation

## Capacity Planning

### Viewing Capacity

See team capacity over time:
1. Go to **Resources** → **Capacity View**
2. See timeline of allocations
3. Identify gaps or overlaps

### Capacity by Role

Understand role coverage:
- Sufficient developers?
- BA coverage during analysis phase?
- QA resources when needed?

## Resource Reports

Generate resource reports:

1. Go to **Reports** → **Resource Utilisation**
2. Select date range
3. View:
   - Hours logged per person
   - Allocation vs actual
   - Utilisation percentage

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Update allocations** - Reflect actual team composition
- **Set dates** - Know when people start and end
- **Track skills** - Match expertise to needs
- **Monitor utilisation** - Identify over/under use
- **Plan ahead** - Book resources before they're needed

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between Resources and Team Members?**
A: Team Members sets permissions and access. Resources focuses on allocation and capacity. They overlap significantly.

**Q: Can I see resources across all projects?**
A: Organisation admins can view resource utilisation across projects. Project-level users see their project only.

**Q: How do I remove someone from the project?**
A: Set their end date to today, or remove from Team Members page.

**Q: Can resources be shared across projects?**
A: Yes, people can have allocations to multiple projects. Their total shouldn't exceed 100%.

# Chapter 7.2: KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

## Overview

KPIs measure project success against defined targets. They provide quantifiable metrics that help you understand if the project is meeting its goals. Tracker includes default KPIs and allows you to create custom indicators.

## Why This Matters

KPIs help you:
- **Measure success** - Objective criteria for performance
- **Track trends** - See improvement or decline over time
- **Communicate status** - Clear metrics for stakeholders
- **Drive behaviour** - What gets measured gets managed
- **Support decisions** - Data-backed choices

## Understanding KPIs

### What Makes a Good KPI

Effective KPIs are:
- **Specific** - Clearly defined
- **Measurable** - Quantifiable
- **Achievable** - Realistic targets
- **Relevant** - Tied to project goals
- **Time-bound** - Measured over defined periods

### KPI Components

Each KPI includes:
- **Name** - What it measures
- **Current value** - Where you are now
- **Target value** - Where you want to be
- **Threshold** - Warning level
- **Trend** - Direction over time

## The KPIs Page

Navigate to **KPIs** from the sidebar.

### KPI Dashboard

Shows all KPIs at a glance:
- Traffic light status (green/amber/red)
- Current value vs target
- Trend indicator (up/down/stable)
- Last updated date

### KPI Detail

Click any KPI to see:
- Full definition
- Historical values
- Chart of trend over time
- Contributing factors

## Default Project KPIs

Tracker includes standard KPIs:

### Schedule Performance Index (SPI)

**What it measures:** Are we on schedule?

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| > 1.0 | Ahead of schedule |
| = 1.0 | On schedule |
| < 1.0 | Behind schedule |

**Calculation:** Earned value / Planned value

### Cost Performance Index (CPI)

**What it measures:** Are we on budget?

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| > 1.0 | Under budget |
| = 1.0 | On budget |
| < 1.0 | Over budget |

**Calculation:** Earned value / Actual cost

### Milestone Completion Rate

**What it measures:** Milestones completed on time

**Target:** Typically 90%+

**Calculation:** On-time completions / Total due completions

### Deliverable Acceptance Rate

**What it measures:** First-time acceptance of deliverables

**Target:** Typically 85%+

**Calculation:** Accepted first time / Total submitted

### Risk Exposure Index

**What it measures:** Overall risk level

**Scale:** Low (0-3), Medium (4-6), High (7-10)

**Factors:** Number, severity, and probability of open risks

## Viewing KPI Status

### Traffic Light System

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Green | Meeting or exceeding target |
| Amber | Below target but above threshold |
| Red | Below threshold - action needed |

### Trend Indicators

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ↑ | Improving |
| → | Stable |
| ↓ | Declining |

## Creating Custom KPIs

### Step 1: Define the KPI

1. Go to **KPIs** → **Manage KPIs**
2. Click **New KPI**
3. Enter:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Category

### Step 2: Configure Measurement

Choose measurement type:
- **Manual** - You enter values periodically
- **Calculated** - System computes from data
- **Derived** - Based on other KPIs

For calculated KPIs:
- Select data source
- Define calculation formula
- Set measurement frequency

### Step 3: Set Targets

Define success criteria:
- **Target value** - Green status
- **Threshold value** - Amber/red boundary
- **Direction** - Higher is better or lower is better

### Step 4: Activate

Review and click **Activate KPI**.

## Updating Manual KPIs

For KPIs that require manual updates:

1. Open the KPI
2. Click **Update Value**
3. Enter current value
4. Add any notes
5. Save

Best practice: Update on a regular schedule (weekly/monthly).

## KPI Reports

Generate KPI-focused reports:

### KPI Summary Report

Shows all KPIs with current status, targets, and trends.

### KPI Trend Report

Shows historical values for selected KPIs over time.

### KPI Scorecard

Executive-friendly view of key metrics with commentary.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Don't overdo it** - 5-10 KPIs maximum
- **Review regularly** - Weekly or monthly KPI reviews
- **Take action** - Red KPIs need intervention
- **Update promptly** - Stale data reduces value
- **Explain context** - Numbers alone don't tell the full story

## Common Questions

**Q: How often should I check KPIs?**
A: Review at least weekly. Include in regular status meetings.

**Q: Can I delete a KPI?**
A: You can deactivate KPIs. Historical data is preserved.

**Q: Who sets KPI targets?**
A: Typically project managers in agreement with stakeholders.

**Q: What if targets are unrealistic?**
A: Targets can be adjusted. Document the reason for changes.

- You're comfortable with the outcome

### When to Override

Override AI recommendations when:
- You have context the AI doesn't
- Business factors require different action
- The recommendation doesn't fit your situation
- Your judgement says otherwise

## AI Limitations

Understanding AI limitations helps set expectations:

### What AI Cannot Do

- Understand unstructured business context
- Know about conversations outside Tracker
- Access information it hasn't been given
- Make decisions for you
- Guarantee accuracy

### When AI May Be Wrong

- Data is incomplete or inaccurate
- Situation is unusual or unprecedented
- Business context is complex
- Multiple valid interpretations exist

### Best Practice

Always apply your professional judgement. AI is a tool that enhances your capabilities, not a replacement for human thinking.

## Configuring AI Features

Most AI features work automatically. Some configurations:

### Enabling/Disabling

AI features are enabled by default. Contact your organisation admin if you need to adjust settings.

### Refresh Behaviour

AI analysis runs when you load pages. Click refresh buttons to re-run analysis manually.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Check daily** - Review Dashboard AI widgets each day
- **Investigate alerts** - Don't dismiss anomalies without checking
- **Use AI documents as drafts** - Edit before sharing
- **Trust but verify** - AI recommendations need human validation
- **Provide feedback** - Report issues to improve the system

## Common Questions

**Q: Is AI always running?**
A: AI analysis runs on page load and manual refresh. There's no continuous background processing.

**Q: Can AI access my data outside Tracker?**
A: No, AI only analyses data within Tracker that you have permission to see.

**Q: What if AI recommendations are wrong?**
A: Ignore them and proceed with your judgement. AI recommendations are suggestions, not requirements.

**Q: Can I turn off AI features?**
A: AI features are integral to the application. You can ignore recommendations but not disable the features.

# Chapter 7.4: Using the AI Chat Assistant

## Overview

The AI Chat Assistant is your conversational interface to Tracker. Ask questions about your project, get help finding information, and execute actions through natural language. It's like having a project assistant available whenever you need one.

## Why This Matters

The Chat Assistant helps you:
- **Find information faster** - Ask instead of navigate
- **Execute actions quickly** - "Submit my timesheets" vs clicking through forms
- **Get help** - Understand features and how to use them
- **Stay in flow** - Accomplish tasks without context switching

## Opening the Chat

The Chat Assistant is available throughout Tracker:

1. Look for the chat icon in the bottom-right corner
2. Click to open the chat panel
3. Panel appears as overlay on current page
4. Type your message and press Enter

## Types of Interactions

### Information Queries

Ask questions to get information:

**Examples:**
- "What's the health score for this project?"
- "Show me overdue deliverables"
- "Who's assigned to the API Integration task?"
- "What milestones are due this month?"
- "Summarise open risks"

**What happens:**
- AI searches project data
- Returns relevant information
- Links to items you can click through

### Help Queries

Ask how to do things:

**Examples:**
- "How do I submit timesheets?"
- "Where can I see expense approvals?"
- "How do I create a variation?"
- "What does baseline breach mean?"

**What happens:**
- AI explains the feature
- Provides step-by-step guidance
- May link to relevant pages

### Action Requests

Ask the AI to do things:

**Examples:**
- "Submit my timesheets"
- "Submit my expenses"
- "Mark milestone 'Design Complete' as done"
- "Complete task 'Write tests'"
- "Close risk R-001"
- "Assign issue I-023 to Sarah"

**What happens:**
1. AI shows preview of what will happen
2. You confirm ("Yes", "Confirm", "Do it")
3. AI executes the action
4. AI confirms success

## The Confirmation Workflow

Actions always require confirmation:

### Preview

When you request an action, AI shows exactly what will happen:

```
You: Submit my timesheets

AI: I found 5 draft timesheets totaling 38 hours:
- Monday: 8 hours (Discovery milestone)
- Tuesday: 7 hours (Discovery milestone)
- Wednesday: 8 hours (Development milestone)
- Thursday: 8 hours (Development milestone)
- Friday: 7 hours (Development milestone)

Do you want me to submit these for approval?
```

### Confirmation

Confirm with natural responses:
- "Yes"
- "Confirm"
- "Do it"
- "Go ahead"
- "Submit them"

### Cancellation

Cancel with:
- "No"
- "Cancel"
- "Never mind"
- Or just change the subject

### Execution

After confirmation:
- AI executes the action
- Confirms what was done
- Reports any errors

## Available Actions

The Chat Assistant can execute these actions:

### Timesheet Actions

| Action | Example Phrases |
|--------|-----------------|
| Submit timesheets | "Submit my timesheets", "Submit all draft timesheets" |

### Expense Actions

| Action | Example Phrases |
|--------|-----------------|
| Submit expenses | "Submit my expenses", "Submit all draft expenses" |

### Milestone Actions

| Action | Example Phrases |
|--------|-----------------|
| Update status | "Mark milestone X as complete" |
| Update progress | "Set milestone X progress to 75%" |

### Deliverable Actions

|--------|-----------------|
| Update status | "Mark deliverable Y as Delivered" |
| Update progress | "Set deliverable progress to 50%" |

### Task Actions

| Action | Example Phrases |
|--------|-----------------|
| Complete task | "Complete task Z", "Mark task 'Write tests' as done" |
| Reassign task | "Reassign task X to Sarah" |

### RAID Actions

| Action | Example Phrases |
|--------|-----------------|
| Update status | "Update issue I-023 to In Progress" |
| Close/resolve | "Close risk R-001", "Resolve issue I-023" |
| Add note | "Add note to risk R-001: Vendor confirmed" |
| Reassign | "Assign dependency D-005 to John" |

## Permission Enforcement

The Chat Assistant respects your permissions:

- You can only do via chat what you can do via UI
- If you lack permission, AI explains why
- No workarounds - permissions always enforced

## Tips for Effective Chat

### Be Specific

**Less effective:** "Update the milestone"
**More effective:** "Mark milestone 'Phase 1 Complete' as done"

### Use Names or References

**Works well:** "Close risk R-001"
**Also works:** "Close the risk about vendor delays"

### Query Before Acting

Not sure what you're affecting? Ask first:
1. "Show me my draft timesheets"
2. Review the list
3. "Submit all of those"

### Confirm Understanding

If AI's preview doesn't match expectations:
- Say "No" or "Cancel"
- Clarify what you meant
- Try again with more specific language

## Common Questions

**Q: Can the Chat Assistant make mistakes?**
A: The AI always shows a preview before acting. Review carefully and only confirm if it's correct.

**Q: What if I confirm by accident?**
A: Most actions can be reversed through normal UI (e.g., change a status back). For submissions, contact your manager.

**Q: Does the chat work on mobile?**
A: Yes, the chat is available on all devices.

**Q: Can I see my chat history?**
A: Chat history is maintained during your session. It resets when you log out or close the browser.

**Q: What can't the chat do?**

# Chapter 7.5: User Journeys - Reporting & AI

This chapter provides practical scenarios showing how reporting and AI features work together.

---

## Journey 1: Preparing for a Steering Committee

### Scenario

Sarah is the Supplier PM preparing for a monthly steering committee meeting tomorrow. She needs to provide status updates to executive stakeholders.

### Gathering the Data

Sarah starts with reports:

1. Opens **Reports** → **Dashboard Summary**
2. Sets date range: Last 30 days
3. Generates the report
4. Notes key metrics:
   - Health score: 74 (amber)
   - Milestones: 4 complete, 2 in progress, 6 remaining
   - Budget: 68% utilised

### Checking AI Insights

Sarah reviews the Dashboard:

1. Opens **Dashboard**
2. Reviews the **Project Forecast** panel:
   - Predicted completion: 2 weeks later than planned
   - Key risks: Testing phase may slip
   - Velocity trend: Slightly declining
3. Checks **Anomaly Alerts**:
   - One deliverable stalled for 5 days
   - She makes a note to address this

### Generating the Status Report

Sarah uses AI to draft her report:

1. Opens **Reports** → **AI Document Generator**
2. Selects "Status Report"
3. Sets period: Last 30 days
4. Clicks **Generate**
5. Waits 15 seconds for AI to create the document
6. Reviews the generated content:
   - Executive summary
   - Progress highlights
   - Key achievements
   - Risks and issues
   - Recommendations

### Refining the Document

Sarah edits the AI draft:

1. Adjusts the executive summary to highlight key decisions needed
2. Adds context about the stalled deliverable (waiting for customer input)
3. Softens the language around the timeline concern
4. Adds specific asks for the steering committee
5. Copies to Word for final formatting

### Additional Reports

Sarah generates supporting materials:

1. **Milestone Status Report** - Visual timeline for discussion
2. **RAID Summary** - Focus on high-priority items
3. **Financial Summary** - Budget breakdown by milestone

### Outcome

For tomorrow's meeting, Sarah has:
- AI-drafted status report (edited and polished)
- Supporting data reports
- Clear asks for the committee
- All prepared in under an hour

### Tips from This Journey

- **Start with AI** - Let it do the heavy lifting
- **Edit thoughtfully** - Add context AI doesn't have
- **Use multiple reports** - Different views for different discussions
- **Prepare asks** - Meetings need decisions, not just updates

---

## Journey 2: Using AI to Detect Issues Early

### Scenario

Tom is a Supplier PM who checks his Dashboard every morning. Today, the AI alerts catch something important.

### Morning Dashboard Review

Tom opens Tracker at 8:30 AM:

1. Opens **Dashboard**
2. Health score: 82 (green) - looking good
3. But **Anomaly Alerts** shows 4 items (unusual)

### Investigating Alerts

Tom clicks through each alert:

**Alert 1: Unusual Timesheet**
- "James logged 14 hours on Saturday"
- Tom knows James was doing emergency production support
- Alert is valid but expected - he'll note this for approval

**Alert 2: Duplicate Expense**
- "Possible duplicate: $127.50 taxi, same date, same amount"
- Tom clicks through and sees two identical expenses
- This is a real issue - Emma accidentally submitted twice
- He rejects one with a note

**Alert 3: Deliverable Stalled**
- "API Documentation hasn't been updated in 8 days"
- Tom checks - status is "In Progress" but no recent activity
- He messages the assignee and discovers they're blocked on a decision
- He escalates to get the decision made

**Alert 4: Approaching Deadline**
- "Milestone 'Testing Complete' due in 3 days, only 65% complete"
- This is concerning - Tom checks the breakdown
- Two test cycles remain, likely won't finish on time
- He starts preparing a variation request

### Taking Action

Based on AI alerts, Tom:

1. Approves the overtime timesheet with a note
2. Rejects the duplicate expense
3. Unblocks the API Documentation work
4. Begins variation for Testing milestone

### Outcome

Without AI alerts, Tom might have:

- Format: 10 minutes
- Total: 55 minutes

**With AI:**
- Generate: 30 seconds
- Edit: 10 minutes
- Send: 2 minutes
- Total: 13 minutes

Emma saved 42 minutes on a weekly task.

### Tips from This Journey

## Journey 4: End-of-Day Review with AI

### Scenario

David is a consultant who uses AI features to wrap up his day efficiently.

### Quick Status Check

At 5:00 PM, David opens the Chat Assistant:

**David:** "What did I complete today?"

**AI:** "Based on task updates today:
- Completed task 'Write API documentation'
- Completed task 'Review test cases'
- Updated deliverable 'Technical Spec' to 90%
You logged 7.5 hours across 2 milestones."

### Timesheet Submission

**David:** "Submit my timesheets for today"

**AI:** "You have 2 time entries for today totaling 7.5 hours:
- 4 hours on Development milestone: 'API documentation work'
- 3.5 hours on Testing milestone: 'Test case review'
Do you want me to submit these?"

**David:** "Yes"

**AI:** "Done. Your timesheets have been submitted for approval."

### Tomorrow's Preview

**David:** "What's due tomorrow?"

**AI:** "Tomorrow (18 January) you have:
- Task 'Integration testing' due
- Deliverable 'Test Report' review scheduled
- Team standup at 9:30 AM (from calendar)"

### RAID Update

David remembers he resolved an issue:

**David:** "Close issue I-023 with note 'Resolved by updating API version'"

**AI:** "I'll close issue I-023 'API compatibility error' with your note. This will change the status to Closed. Confirm?"

**David:** "Confirm"

**AI:** "Done. Issue I-023 is now closed with your resolution note."

### Outcome

In 5 minutes via chat, David:
- Reviewed his day's work
- Submitted timesheets
- Previewed tomorrow
