- **Phase 2:** RFP development & vendor response management
- **Phase 3:** Vendor evaluation & scoring
- **Phase 4:** Decision support & vendor selection
- **Timeline:** 20 weeks (January-May 2026)

## 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS (Must Build)

### 1. Live Workshop Collaboration (40h)
**Why:** Requirements gathering happens in workshops; need real-time entry + voting
- Real-time requirement entry
- Live vote counts (priority indicators)
- Real-time duplicate detection
- Facilitator controls (pause, lock, finalize)
- **Impact:** CRITICAL for Phase 1

### 2. Client Approval Portal (20h)
**Why:** Stakeholders need to review and approve requirements before RFP
- Separate from vendor portal
- Requirements review + approval voting
- Comments on individual requirements
- Stakeholder area dashboard
- **Impact:** CRITICAL for Phase 1 completion

### 3. Post-Submission Q&A Forum (12h)
**Why:** Vendors need to ask clarification questions during evaluation
- Vendors post questions
- Evaluators respond (48h SLA)
- All vendors see anonymized questions + answers
- **Impact:** CRITICAL for vendor experience

### 4. AI Response Analysis with Scoring (8h)
**Why:** Evaluators need AI assistance to quickly understand vendor responses
- Summarize response text
- Extract key points
- Flag compliance gaps
- **Suggest score** (0-5 with confidence level)
- **Impact:** HIGH for evaluation efficiency

### 5. Traceability Matrix View (8h)
**Why:** Complete transparency from requirements → RFP questions → responses → scores
- Interactive matrix: Requirements × Vendors
- Color-coded scores (heatmap)
- Click-through to original requirement, question, response, scoring rationale
- **Impact:** HIGH for decision transparency

### 6. Risk Dashboard (12h)
**Why:** Track integration risks, vendor risks, implementation risks
- Risk identification and scoring
- Mitigation plan tracking
- Status dashboard for stakeholders
- **Impact:** MEDIUM for governance

---

## 🟡 IMPORTANT FEATURES (Should Build)

- **RFP Templates** (24h) - Pre-built templates for CSP evaluations
- **AI Consolidation** (20h) - Auto-detect duplicate requirements
- **PDF Report Generation** (8h) - Professional reports for steering committee
- **Email Notifications** (16h) - Smart alerts for key milestones
- **Scenario Comparison** (6h) - "What if" analysis on weightings
- **Financial Analysis** (6h) - 3-year TCO comparison per vendor

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Option A: Accelerated (3 Weeks, 2 Developers)
**Team:** 2 part-time developers working in parallel
- Frontend Developer: Client portal, vendor portal enhancements, UI components
- Backend Developer: APIs, database schema, AI integration, Supabase setup

**Pros:** Faster delivery, lower risk, good collaboration  
**Cons:** Coordination overhead, higher hourly cost  
**Cost:** £32-40k development

### Option B: Standard (5 Weeks, 1 Developer)
**Team:** 1 full-time senior developer
- Handles full stack (frontend + backend + DevOps)

**Pros:** Simpler coordination, clear ownership  
**Cons:** Single point of failure, higher risk, slower delivery  
**Cost:** £28-35k development

**Recommendation:** **Option A (2 developers)** - Better for CSP timeline pressure
